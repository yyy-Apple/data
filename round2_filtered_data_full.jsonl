For example, function $f(x,y)=xy$ in the positive angle $\\{x>0,y>0\\}$ satisfy Laplace equation (stationary heat) equation.

It states that if $x_0$ is a point of solution's local minimum at the boundary then in any neibourhood there is a point in which normal derivative is positive. For parabolic equations it was generalized by Kamynin. Since domains with angles is sort of good Lipschitz, may be something analogous holds there.

{"problem": "What is causing the front-end vibration in my 2002 Trailblazer, which increases over time and is noticeable through the steering wheel, despite recent repairs to the passenger CV shaft and 4WD disconnect?", "final_answer": "It was driver-side wheel bearing.", "raw_text": "Retrieved from http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/2668/02-trailblazer-with-front-end-vibration-which-seems-to-increase-over-time?answertab=votes\nText:\nTake the 2-minute tour \u00d7\n\nAbout a month ago my trailblazer developed this new features. When you get into the car and start driving, everything feels completely fine. Then after about 5 minutes you start noticing slight vibration (very slight, just feels like something isn't quite right). After about a 20 minute drive, the vibration is very noticeable. By that time, it almost sounds like low engine rumble, but its pitch and volume vary directly with car's speed, not engine speed. When it gets to that level, it is also easily felt in the steering wheel.\n\nThree weeks ago, I jacked the car up and noticed that there was a ton of grease spewed around passenger side CV boot. So I went through the motion, which took a while for various reasons, of replacing passenger CV shaft and while in there, also rebuilt 4WD disconnect with fresh bearings and seals. Yesterday I put the car back on the road and the vibration is still in there unchanged.\n\nI tugged on both wheels to check wheel hubs and at first glace the wheel bearings appear fine. I've had bad wheel bearings on this car before, left one is 5 years old. right one is 1 year old. Whenever wheel bearings were bad a) vibration would be constant through out the drive (i.e. you can feel it the second you start driving) and b) they would change in sound when turning left or right.\n\nThis current vibration is... 1) unaffected by turning left/right or going straight 2) does not change in sound if 4wd is engaged or disengaged 3) unaffected by putting the car in neutral and revving the engine\n\nI also checked the front differential fluid level (obviously destroying the fill plug in the process) and topped off the oil level. It was a little low, but no where near empty.\n\nAny ideas what would be causing it?\n\nUPDATE: Drove the car to work today. I have to take back (1) from above. If I turn the steering wheel right, vibration becomes stronger and if I turn left it gets weaker, which is actually consistent with driver's side wheel bearing being bad. The difference is that with my previous bad bearings, I only had to apply slight pressure to the steering wheel to hear sound difference, but this time, I have to push the steering wheel a bit further out (can still hear difference in a single lane going straight). Also the vibration this time seems to be distinctly lower pitch than the ones I've heard in the past with wheel bearings, but maybe they come in different shapes and sounds?\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n2 Answers\n\nI also have a AWD Trailblazer, and low diff oil can cause uneven gear wear (mine is perennially low because I have a leaking diff seal which the dealer can't get out). As the oil heats up, the vibration can become more prominent because the thick oil is no longer damping the vibration.\n\nYou may also want to check that your wheels are balanced. You might have chucked a wheel weight or worn a tire unevenly. But, the noise you describe (through the steering wheel) definitely sounds to me like a worn front diff.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nNick, although I appreciate a response, that is sooooo not what I wanted to hear :). Stupid TB. I did have the same suspicion, that' why I topped off the fluid, but I can't say it was that low. And btw, I did also notice that the differential pinion seal is leaking oil on my car as well. Stupid TB. \u2013\u00a0 DXM Jan 16 '12 at 20:44\nadd comment\n\nIt was driver-side wheel bearing.\n\nI've had 4 other bad wheel bearings (2 in this car, 1 in wife's BMW 330i and 1 in my old Integra) and they've always sounded the same. Smooth, mid- to high-pitch vibration which almost disappears when you turn the wheel one way or another.\n\nWhat confused me was this noise was much rougher (like I said in original question, almost low engine rumble) and at first it happened at any steering wheel angle. Past few days I did notice change in pitch/volume when moving the steering wheel but it wasn't like that at first.\n\nOne clue that told it it was probably a wheel bearing was after I came home few days ago, I felt the rims and driver side was significantly warmer than passenger side, which I would guess caused by extra friction in the bad hub.\n\nNow the car is back on the road and feels as smooth as butter.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

Thanks for a well-written question - it really helps to \nknow just what part you have trouble with.\n\nThe key to this step is that\n\n     x^-a    1           1     x^a\n     ---- = ---   and   ---- = ---\n      1     x^a         x^-a    1\n\nThat's essentially just the definition of negative exponents, and I'll \nassume you're at least aware of this as a fact. What you need is how \nto apply it.\n\nWhat these facts mean in practice is that you can move a factor from \ntop to bottom or from bottom to top and negate the exponent. Once you \nget used to it, you just think \"There's an x^-8 in the numerator, so I \ncan replace that with an x^8 in the denominator.\" To take it more \nslowly, we can pull the expression apart, apply the rule, and put it \nback together:\n\n     x^-8 y^7   x^-8   y^7    1     1     1    y^7    1     1\n     -------- = ---- * --- * --- * --- = --- * --- * --- * ---\n     y^3 x^6      1     1    y^3   x^6   x^8    1    y^3   x^6\n\n              = -----------\n                x^8 y^3 x^6\n\nThat makes all the exponents positive, but there's still another step \nyou didn't mention: combining like factors so that x and y each appear \nonly once. That's easy in the denominator now; we can just permute so \nthe x's are together and add the exponents:\n\n         y^7         y^7\n     x^8 y^3 x^6   x^14 y^3\n\nBut you still have y in two places. We can use the same rule to get \nthe y's together; since 7 > 3, let's move the y^3 to the top to keep \nthe exponents positive:\n\n       y^7      y^7    1      1    y^7    1     y^-3   y^7 y^-3   y^4\n     -------- = --- * ---- * --- = --- * ---- * ---- = -------- = ----\n     x^14 y^3    1    x^14   y^3    1    x^14     1      x^14     x^14\n\nNow we're really done.\n\nBut we've taken a lot more steps than we had to. That's fine when \nyou're starting out; this isn't a race. But here's how I'd do it \n\n     x(x^-3)^2y(xy^-2)^-3   x x^-6 y x^-3 y^6\n     (y^2)^3y^-3(x^2)^3     y^6 y^-3 x^6\n\n                          = x x^-6 y x^-3 y^6 * y^-6 y^3 x^-6\n\n                            (Here I've moved everything to the top.)\n\n                          = x x^-6 x^-3 x^-6 * y y^6 y^-6 y^3\n\n                            (Here I've gathered the x's and y's \n                             together; I'd probably mark each factor \n                             as I copied it to make sure I didn't miss \n\n                          = x^(1-6-3-6) y^(1+6-6+3)\n\n                          = x^-14 y^4\n\n                          = ----\n\nIf you're at all afraid of negative exponents, this will make you \ndizzy, but if you like to take the bull by the horns and get it over \nwith, making the negative exponents work for you, this is the way to \ndo it. Basically, I decided I'd rather deal with positive and negative \nexponents than with numerators and denominators; they're really two \nways to say the same thing, and mixing them doesn't make sense. So \neven though the goal is to have numerator and denominator and \neliminate negative exponents, I found that it's really easier to work \nwith the negatives, then change them to denominators when I'm done.\n\nIf any of this overwhelmed you, or if you have more questions, feel \nfree to write back.\n\n- Doctor Peterson, The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nHigh School Basic Algebra\nHigh School Exponents\nMiddle School Algebra\nMiddle School Exponents\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM\n\u00a9 1994-2013 The Math Forum"}

But 'key not in 2' leads to 'key in 2' (so a contradiction), as follows:\n\nBy (c), not in 2 implies in 1. By (b) then, not in 3. By (a) then, key is in 2. Contradiction.\n\nTo be safe, you can check if the game makers messed up:\n\nAs 'key in 1' is a sub chain of the above, it also leads to 'key in 2'. Contradiction.\n\nSimilarly, 'key in 3' means by uniqueness that 2 holds brass, which, by (c), implies 1 holds the key. Contradiction.\n\nFinally note that if the key is in 2, it doesn't lead to any contradictions. So game is correct.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nCell 2 cannot hold worthless brass, and cell 1 cannot have the gold key.\n\nIf a cell can have neither brass nor key, then that is the limit of what you can conclude. For example, your conditions are consistent with cell 3 having the key and there being nothing in the other cells.\n\nBut if every cell contains either brass or key, then you know cell 2 has the key. You can prove that by assuming cell 2 did not have the key, and hence had worthless brass. That implies that cell 1 has the key, which implies cell 3 has worthless brass which implies that cell 2 has the key. Contradiction.\n\nHowever, if that additional condition were part of the problem, then your middle condition would be redundant.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nSorry to be contrary, but I believe you need 2 assumptions for there to be a unique solution. First, that all 3 statements are indeed true. If we allow that one or more of those statements doesn't hold, the whole thing falls apart.\n\nSecond, that each cell contains either brass or the key. No empty cells. If you disagree, try looking at these 2 solutions:\n\nCell 1 = Empty, Cell 2 = Key, Cell 3 = Empty\n\nCell 1 = Empty, Cell 2 = Empty, Cell 3 = Key\n\nNone of the 3 statements apply to either of these, so they're both possible valid solutions and you're left to guess and hope the spiders don't eat your face.\n\nNow, you can brute force your way through by listing all possible solutions and checking which are valid under the given statements. In this case there aren't many possible choices, so that approach is not too bad. However, I'm assuming you're looking for a bit deeper insight, so I'll walk through a technique that can sometimes provide a quicker route to the answer, especially in more complex puzzles.\n\nSince all the implications are one way (they are \"if\", not \"if and only if\"), one approach is to start by assuming a condition from the left side of a statement and trace the implications through all the statements to look for inconsistencies.\n\nJust going in order, let's assume first that Cell 3 holds brass. Then by statement 1, Cell 2 holds the key. Since we're assuming key or brass in each and only one key, then Cell 1 would have to be brass. Given that, neither of the last 2 statements apply, so this solution is possible with no contradictions. Let's continue and check the others to be sure we have the only possible valid solution.\n\nLooking at statement 2, let's assume now that Cell 1 holds the key. By statement 2, Cell 3 holds brass. By statement 1, Cell 2 holds the key. Since only 1 cell can hold the key, this is a contradiction.

If the first statement is false, you have 3 holds brass and 2 does not hold the gold key. Given that there is a gold key, it must be behind door 1. Then the second and third statements would be true, but we still don't know whether cell 2 holds brass.\n\nIf the second statement is false, cell 1 has gold and 3 does not have brass (so is empty). The first and third sentences are then true and we again know nothing about cell 2.\n\nIf the third statement is false, 2 holds brass and 1 does not have gold, so it must be cell 3 that has gold. The other two are then true and we don't know what 1 holds.\n\nSince we didn't reach a contradiction from any of these, we can't choose between them. I would downvote the puzzle creator. However, if you ignore the \"not all that is said is true\" and believe them all, gnometorule has shown how to get there.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

This terms is controled by the second derivative of the function (it clearly vanishes for a linear function) at it is bounded by $O(1/n^4)$, since the number of squares is $O(n^2)$ the estimate on this whole term is $O(1/n^2)$,\n\n  \u2022 the error term in the boundary squares, those on which the function takes both a $>0$ and a zero value. On those squares the error is $O(1/n^3)$ and the number or such boundary squares is $O(n)$ so we get again a bound $O(1/n^2)$.\n\n(Note that a complete argument has to be more precise because the function $f$ could have zero derivative at the points where it vanishes, then the number of boundary squares is $O(n^2)$ but I think the result does not change).\n\nTo check that this estimate is optimal you can think of a function which is invariant under a rotation of angle $\\pi/2$ and equal to say $N-x$ on $y>0, -y+u\\leq x\\leq y-u$ for some small $u>0$. Then the first error term can be made smaller than the second, while the second \"boundary\" error term is indeed of the order of $1/n^2$ (the boundary errors all sum up).\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThe errors in each cell tend to compensate. If instead of having a compactly supported function with limited regularity, we have a functin $F$ in the Schwartz class, then the total error is $O(n^{-k})$ for every $k>0$. This is a consequence of the Poisson summation formula and the fact that the Fourier transform of $F$ is of Schwartz class too. Therefore the question is really about the effect of the limited regularity of $F$, and whether the concavity helps. \u2013\u00a0 Denis Serre Aug 18 '11 at 16:14\nI agree but as stated the main error term comes from the boundary squares. In some cases at least no compensation occurs, as in the example I tried to described, where all centers of boundary squares are at points where $f=0$ so that all those boundary terms are positive. \u2013\u00a0 Jean-Marc Schlenker Aug 18 '11 at 17:48\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

Let me add a straightforward proof (for $S_n$ and only $S_n$).\n\nFor a permutation $\\sigma:\\{1,\\dots,n\\}\\to\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, let $\\lambda(\\sigma)$ denote the number of inversions in $\\sigma$, that is the number of pairs $(i,j)$ such that $i<j$ and $\\sigma(i)>\\sigma(j)$. Then $\\lambda(\\sigma)$ equals the length of $\\sigma$ with respect to the generating set $\\{s_i\\}$.\n\nIndeed, left-multiplying $\\sigma$ by $s_i$ only interchanges $\\sigma(i)$ and $\\sigma(i+1)$, and hence changes $\\lambda(\\sigma)$ by at most 1. Therefore the length is bounded below by $\\lambda$. On the other hand, if $\\sigma$ is not the identity, there exists $i$ such that $\\sigma(i+1)<\\sigma(i)$, then left-multiplying by $s_i$ decreases $\\lambda(\\sigma)$ by 1. Repeating this procedure, one reaches the identity from $\\sigma$ by exactly $\\lambda(\\sigma)$ multiplications by generators.\n\nNow it is clear that the maximum length equals $n(n-1)/2$ and is attained only at the order reversing permutation (the one given by $\\sigma(i)=n+1-i$ for all $i$).\n\nshare|improve this answer\n+1 for the first sentence :) \u2013\u00a0 JBL Dec 14 '10 at 12:40\nTo combine with Qiaochu's answer: inversions $\\sigma(i)>\\sigma(j)$ correspond to flipped roots $e_i-e_j$. So the proof here extends easily to other root systems with their own notion of inversions, e.g. for the group of signed permutations. \u2013\u00a0 Allen Knutson Dec 14 '10 at 19:06\nadd comment\n\nYes; this is known as the longest element, and it exists and is unique for every finite Coxeter group (including the ones which do not arise as Weyl groups). The length of the longest element is the number of positive roots in the corresponding root system; here that number is ${n \\choose 2}$. A standard reference here is Humphreys' Reflection groups and Coxeter groups; Proposition 5.6b is relevant, and this is the content of Exercise 2 in that section.\n\nTo be more explicit (and to explain Tobias' answer), specialized to symmetric groups Proposition 5.6b says the following: let $S_n$ act on the orthogonal complement of the all-ones vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in the obvious way. This complement is spanned by elements of the form $e_i - e_j, 1 \\le i \\neq j \\le n$; a choice of positive roots for the corresponding root system can be obtained by considering the elements with $i > j$, of which there are ${n \\choose 2}$. Then the length of $w \\in S_n$ is the number of positive roots $e_i - e_j$ sent to their negatives $e_j - e_i$ (which, one readily verifies, is the number of inversions in $w$). And there is a unique permutation that does this to every positive root: just send $k$ to $n + 1 - k$.\n\nOne way to interpret this result is that the length of an element $w \\in S_n$ (with its usual Coxeter system) is the least number of steps required to sort the word $w_1 w_2 ... w_n$ using bubblesort, and of course the word $n (n-1) (n-2) ... 3 2 1$ takes ${n \\choose 2}$ steps to sort and is maximal (since $n$ is moved $n-1$ times, $n-1$ is moved $n-2$ times, etc.)\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThe bit \"...their negatives $e_j - e_i$...\" is wrong above.

One way to see this is that $S_n$ is the Weyl-group of the simple Lie algebra of type $A_{l-1}$, and here the length can be characterized by fixing a set of simple roots (and thus of positive roots). The length is then the number of positive roots that are sent to negative roots. The unique longest element is then the one that sends each simple root to its negative (the product of the simple reflections corresponding to each simple root)\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nA more explicit version of Qiaochu's answer : $S_n$ can be viewed as a Coxeter group of type $A_{n-1}$. The maximal length is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, achieved by the element $$s_1(s_2s_1)(s_3s_2s_1) \\ldots (s_{n-1}s_{n-2} \\ldots s_2s_1)$$.\n\nThis is a classical result in Coxeter groups theory. Sketch of the proof : for each $i \\in [1,n-1]$ let $G_i$ be the so-called parabolic subgroup generated by $T_i=\\lbrace s_1,s_2, \\ldots ,s_n \\rbrace $. For any $w\\in G_k (1 \\leq k \\leq n-1)$ we can write $w=w_1w_2w_3 \\ldots w_r$ where each $w_i \\in T_k$ and $r$ is minimal. Among all those decompositions, we choose the one with as many generators in $T_{k-1}$ on the left as possible. This shows that $w$ can be written $w=w'x$, with $w'\\in G_{k-1}$, and $x\\in X_k$ where $X_k$ consists of the element $x\\in G_k$ all of whose minimal decompositions start with $s_k$.\n\nIt is not hard to show that the pair $(w',x)$ is unique (this is because $G_{k-1}$ and $X_k$ are disjoint) and trivially we have $l(w)=l(w')+l(x)$. By induction, any $w\\in S_n$ can be written uniquely $w=x_1x_2 \\ldots x_n$, where each $x_i$ is in $X_i$, and furthermore $l(w)=l(x_1)+l(x_2)+ \\ldots +l(x_n)$.\n\nNow, when the group is $S_n$ it is a straightforward exercise to show that $$X_k=\\lbrace s_{k},s_{k}s_{k-1}, \\ldots, s_{k}s_{k-1} \\ldots s_{2}s_{1} \\rbrace$$ for any $k$. Therefore $X_k$ has a unique element of maximal length, $\\xi_k=s_{k}s_{k-1} \\ldots s_{2}s_{1}$, and we deduce that $S_n$ has a unique element of maximal length which is the product $\\xi_1\\xi_2 \\ldots \\xi_{n-1}$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

The basic way to achieve this is to arrange Spec $B$ to be the union of two components, one which maps dominantly to Spec $A$ and one which doesn't, and take $Q$ to be a point lying (only) on the component that doesn't map dominantly. This is what happens in YACP's answer: Spec $B$ is two lines crossing, Spec $A$ is a single line, and the map is the identity on the first line and constant on the second line.

Let D be the sum of the distances from \nP to the 3 vertices, and let E be the sum of the shortest distances \nfrom P to the edges (trilinear coordinates of P). Prove that D > 2*E.\n\nI have beaten this to death using analytic geometry and calculus to \nfind the point P which minimizes D-2*E and then prove that D-2*E at P \nis greater than 0. I have used a number of different parameterizations \nof the triangle using 3 numbers (xy coordinates of one vertex and the \nlength of the opposite side, two angles and length of one side, length \nof all three sides) and expressed D and E in these terms, calculated \nthe partial derivative of (D-2*E) with respect to the parameters, etc. \nI continually end up with intractable expressions.\n\nI have tried all geometrical approaches that I know to construct the \nFermat point - but it's clear that point P above is not related to the \nFermat point. (I have a number of proofs now of the Fermat point \n\nI have solved special cases (e.g. if <A + <B > 90 deg. and <A < 15 \ndeg. then D-2*E > 0), and also proved it for an isosceles triangles \nwhere P is on the altitude, and for right triangles, and have found \nmany cases where point P is the vertex opposite the shortest side.\nBut I have not found a simple general proof that D > 2*E.\n\nIn xy coordinates the problem reduces to something like the following:\n\nProve H > 0 where\n     H =  cos(b) - 2*sin(B) - (X*cos(w) - Y*sin(w))\n\nand we know that at point P the two partial derivatives require that\n\n     1)  cos(a) - cos(b) + cos(c) = 2*(sin(B) - sin(C))\n     2)  sin(a) + sin(b) - sin(c) = 2*(1 - cos(B) - cos(C))  \n\nwhere A, B and C are the 3 angles of the triangle; a, b and c are the \n3 angles of the triangle with P as a vertex, and (X,Y) are the \ncoordinates of one of the vertices of the triangle. The symmetries of \nthe above are obvious, but I cannot get the last step.\n\nI am working with my father to solve a recent problem from the AMM \nproblem section and the first step is to prove D > 2*E.

This theorem is known as the Erdos-Mordell \ntheorem, but it should read D >= 2*E.\n\nLet's consider the following:\n\n\nWe have that D, E and F are the feet of the perpendicular altitudes \nfrom P to AB, BC and CA respectively, while E' and F' are the feet of \nthe perpendicular altitudes from E and F to AB.\n\nCFPE is a cyclic quadrilateral because the opposite angles are \nsupplementary. PC is its diameter. We also know that the radius of the \ncircumcircle of EFC is EF/(2*sin(C)), and thus the diameter is \nEF/sin(C). This means that EF = PC*sin(C). Since EF >= E'F' this gives \n\n     PC*sin(C) >= E'F'   ........................................[1]\n\nAlso, we have \n\n     F'E' = F'D + DE' \n          = PF*cos(90-A) + PE*cos(90-B)\n          = PF*sin(A) + PE*sin(B)         .......................[2]\n\nThe combination of [1] and [2] shows that\n\n     PC * sin(C) >= PF*sin(A) + PE*sin(B)\n\n                        sin(A)       sin(B)\n              PC >= PF* ----- + PE * ----- \n                        sin(C)       sin(C)\n\nIn the same way you find similar results for PA and PB. These three \nexpressions combine to:\n     PA+PB+PC >=\n\n         sin(A)  sin(B)       sin(B)  sin(C)       sin(A)  sin(C)\n     PD*(----- + -----) + PE*(----- + -----) + PF*(----- + -----)\n         sin(B)  sin(A)       sin(C)  sin(B)       sin(C)  sin(A)\n\n              >= 2*(PD + PE + PF)\n\nbecause x + 1/x >= 2.\n\nAnd we have proven the Erdos-Mordell theorem (from 1935).

One answer is: when it is not pierced at 'the target point', there is a pressure acting on the target point (I should say area, but nevermind) on the right from the inside, as well as on its mirror point on the left, and so for every pair of points, so that the total force is zero. When you pierce the can, there still is some pressure acting on the mirror point, but there is no pressure acting on the target point, so that the total force acting on the can is not zero, and is directed to the left. (One can check that the force is the same as if you use conservation of momentum for the whole can+air system). What is pressure? Pressure is transition of momentum from air to the walls. When you pierce the target point, the momentum goes not to the can, but to the environment, and gets absorbed somewhere there.\n\nWhat changes when you pierce a vacuum can? Now the pressure acts from the outside, and now, when you pierce the can, the force on the mirror point is again not compensated and is directed to the right. So one may conclude that the can should move. But one thing is different: the momentum that was to be transfered to the target point from the outside (but was not, because there is now no surface at the target point) is not absorbed \"somewhere\", it goes inside the can, and is finally absorbed by it exactly canceling the momentum received by the mirror point.\n\nSo, in this case there is a rather subtle cancelation. However, I believe that there are some further subtleties, which may cause a small difference in these momenta, and if you try to measure the force really hard, then you will see it.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n-1 Momentum must be conserved.

In this case, 86 rounds up to 90, and 192 rounds down to \n190.

The equation I'm integrating doesn't have an x in it anywhere. I don't think I can say du/2x=dx because I will have x's and u's in the integral, which is no good. However, I can't just ignore it.\n\n    Also, how did that z^2 get in there on the bottom? z is a constant in this integration and since u = z^2+x^2, the z-term drops right out.

So divide the row in sets $S_k = \\{4k + 1, 4k + 2, 4k + 3, 4k + 4\\}$ for $k = 0, \\ldots, 7$ and $S_8 = \\{33, 34, 35\\}$.

For the proof, it is useful to let $c=x+1$. Then our expression becomes $$(x^2+3x+1)(x^2-x+1).$$ Note that $x^2-x+1$ is always odd. Any common divisor of $x^2+3x+1$ and $x^2-x+1$ must divide the difference $4x$. But such a common divisor must be odd, so any common divisor must divide $x$. But then it must divide $1$.\n\nThus $x^2+3x+1$ and $x^2-x+1$ are relatively prime. Since $x^2-x+1$ is always positive, it follows that if their product is a perfect square, each must be a perfect square.\n\nBut that can only happen when $x=0$. To prove this, use the fact that for any integer $u$, there is no perfect square strictly between $u^2$ and $(u+1)^2$. Since you asked for a hint, I will, unless you request otherwise, leave out the rest of the argument. It is short.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

Let $F_X$ be the cumulative distribution function of $X$ (that is $F_X(t)=\\mathbb P(X\\le t)$) and $F_Y$ be the cumulative distribution function of $Y$.\n\nIn your notation, probably $F_X(t)=\\int_0^t p(s)\\,ds$ and $F_Y(y)=\\int_0^t q(t)\\,dt$.\n\nNow define two functions on $[0,1]$: $g_X(x)=\\sup\\lbrace t\\colon \\mathbb P(X\\le t)\\le x\\rbrace $ and similarly $g_Y(x)=\\sup\\lbrace t\\colon \\mathbb P(Y\\le t)\\le x\\rbrace$. These functions are the increasing rearrangements of $X$ and $Y$. That is these are non-decreasing functions with the property that $m\\lbrace x\\colon g_X(x)\\le t\\rbrace =\\mathbb P(X\\le t)$ and $m\\lbrace x\\colon g_Y(x)\\le t\\rbrace = \\mathbb P(Y\\le t)$.\n\nNow the largest possible value of $\\mathbb E XY$ given the distributions is $\\int_0^1 g_X(t)g_Y(t)\\ dt$. Intuitively the reason for this is that the largest value for the expectation is obtained when the largest values of $X$ are multiplied by the largest values of $Y$. Slightly more precisely imagine you've arranged the $X$ values from largest to smallest. Think of these as \"weights\" for the $Y$ values. Obviously you get the biggest integral if you weight the big $Y$ values with the biggest weights.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nDear Anthony, Thank you very much for your answer! A few questions: - Is this bound better than Holder's inequality's bound \ud835\udd3c[XY] <= E[X^p]^(1/p)*E[Y^q]^(1/q) with q>1,p>1,1/p+1/q = 1?

Thanks you Best Michele \u2013\u00a0 Michele Oct 9 '12 at 23:54\nThe justification is in my answer. For more, you could try Lindvall's book \"Lectures on the Coupling Method\". This is the best possible bound: If you let $\\omega$ be uniformly distributed in the unit interval, then $g_X(\\omega)$ has the same distribution as $X$ and $g_Y(\\omega)$ has the same distribution as $Y$ and the product of these random variables has the integral in my answer. \u2013\u00a0 Anthony Quas Oct 10 '12 at 5:19\nDear Anthony, Still, it is not clear to me how to prove the inequality that you suggested : E[X*Y] <= \\int_{0}^{1} dt g_{X}(t) * g_{Y}(t). Is the proof in the book \"Lectures on the Coupling Method\"? It it not clear either wether and why this bound is better than the Holder's inequality bound E[X^p]^(1/p)*E[Y^q]^(1/q). Can you prove this? Thanks! Michele \u2013\u00a0 Michele Oct 16 '12 at 1:05\nIf you know that $X$ is uniformly distributed on the unit interval and $Y$ are is the uniformly distributed random variable on [1,2], then the bound I'm suggesting comes from $g_X(t)=t$, $g_Y(t)=1+t$, so that $\\mathbb E XY\\le \\int (t+t^2)\\,dt=5/6$. If you use H\\\"older's inequality, you get $(1/(p+1))^{1/p}((2^{q+1}-1)/(q+1))^{1/q}$. This is greater than 5/6 for all $1/p+1/q=1$. My bound is attained if $X$ is uniform and $Y=1+X$. In general, my bound is always attained for some joint distribution on $X$ and $Y$. The Holder bound is not always attained. So mine is lower and is best poss. \u2013\u00a0 Anthony Quas Oct 16 '12 at 5:57\nApparently the inequality I'm quoting goes by the name \"Hardy-Littlewood inequality\".

If we added a mass term without introducing the Higgs field, but the coupling current is still conserved, at what point would the theory break down? It seems to me that the scalar modes decouple as well, at least to tree level. I failed to push the calculation to one loop order, so maybe the theory breaks down here. Is this the most immediate source of problems, or is there any simpler observable which fails to be gauge invariant?\n\nOne would often hear that if we break gauge invariance the theory is no longer renormalisable. I may be too na\u00efve but it seems to me that a (gauge-fixed) massive gauge boson has a $\\mathcal O(p^{-2})$ propagator and therefore (as long as the current in the vertices is conserved) the theory is (power counting) renormalisable. Or is it?\n\nTo keep things focused, let us imagine that we wanted to give gluons mass, while keeping self-interactions and the coupling to matter (and ghosts) unchanged. Could this work without a Higgs?\n\nThere are many posts about that are asking similar things. For example,\n\n  \u2022 4\n    $\\begingroup$ Nothing goes wrong, just the theory becomes strongly coupled at $4\\pi m_V/g$ where $m_V$ is the mass and $g$ the gauge coupling. It is simple to see this because the longitudinal polarization grows with energy. In fact, by a gauge redefinition one can make this apparent reintroducing the eaten Goldstone bosons. In practice, the Higgs mechanism is there in any case, it's the Higgs particle that could be missing. The theory has a cutoff which is at most $4\\pi v$, where $v=m_V/g$ is the vev, as for any theory of Goldstone bosons that are derivatively coupled. The simplest UV completion adds h. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0TwoBs Dec 6 '16 at 16:05\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ @TwoBs thanks for the comment. What you describe is not really true for an abelian gauge theory: the longitudinal polarisations would grow, but in fact they cancel (because of current conservation) and therefore the S matrix elements don't grow with energy (massive QED is UV finite, and perturbatively unitary). But this seems to fail for non-abelian gauge theories. Why is a non-abelia gauge theory different than an abelian one? is it because, unlike QED, the longitudinal polarisations don't cancel (even if the current is conserved)? $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0AccidentalFourierTransform Dec 6 '16 at 16:20\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ It's very simple to understand: for the abelian case the mass gives rise just a free kinetic term for the would be goldstone bosons, whereas for the non-abelian case it give rise to a non-trivial derivatively coupled interactions. The reason is because the coset structure of$U(1)\\rightarrow 0$ is a circle which is one-dimensional and hence there is no non trivial Riemann curvature, whereas for non-abelian cosets, e.g. $SU(2)\\rightarrow U(1)$, they have non trivial Riemann ( it's a sphere above). The longitudinal polarizations, that is the Goldstones, couple with coefficients given by Riemann. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0TwoBs Dec 6 '16 at 23:05\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ @TwoBs nice, thanks!

I have good news and bad news. The good news is that this exact same question is asked and answered in Quantum Field Theory, by Itzykson & Zuber, section 12-5-2. The bad news is that the answer is\n\nIf you introduce mass terms in non-abelian gauge theories by hand, the theory is non-renormalisable.\n\nThis means that one is forced to introduce the Higgs mechanism (or variations thereof, such as the St\u00fcckelberg mechanism), which for some people is rather inelegant (and plagued by problems of naturalness, etc). Oh well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.\n\nLet me quote the first paragraph of the aforementioned section, so as to summarise the main point of the problem:\n\nIs a gauge theory where mass terms are introduced by hand renormalizable?\n\nIn electrodynamics, the situation is favorable. After separation of the gauge field into transverse and longitudinal components, the longitudinal part $k_\\mu k_\\nu/M^2$ which gives rise to the bad behavior in the propagator does not contribute to the $S$ matrix. This results from the noninteraction of longitudinal and transverse components and from the coupling of the field to a conserved current. In a nonabelian theory, none of these properties is satisfied. Longitudinal and transverse parts do interact, while the current to which the gauge field is coupled is not conserved. On the other hand, unexpected cancellations of divergences at the one-loop level make the theory look like renormalizable. This explains why it took some time to reach a consensus, namely, that the theory is not renormalizable. The way out of this unpleasant situation is to appeal to the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, to be explained in the next subsection.\n\n\nYour Answer"}
{"problem": "What is the expected number of rolls required to obtain a specific outcome (e.g., rolling a six) when using a fair six-sided die?", "final_answer": "6", "raw_text": "Retrieved from https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/42930/what-is-the-expected-value-of-the-number-of-die-rolls-necessary-to-get-a-specifi\nText:\nGiven a discrete random number generator, such as a six-sided die, what is the expected value of the number of rolls necessary to roll a specific number (e.g. a six)?\n\nI think the result should be given by E$\\langle$rolls$\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{6}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{(\\frac{5}{6})^n(n+1)}$, but I don't know how to calculate the convergence of that sum.\n\nAlso, how do I calculate the variance?\n\n\nA slightly simpler recursive derivation is this. We must roll the die at least once. On the first roll we get a 6 with probability $\\frac{1}{6}$. Otherwise we start again. Hence, $E = 1 + \\frac{5}{6}E$, which gives $E=6$.\n\nHere is a more general answer:\n\nRegard rolling the die as a Bernoulli process $X_1,X_2, \\ldots$, where $X_i = $ Success, with probability $p$, and $X_i = $ Failure, with probability $1-p$. The process stops after the first success.\n\nLet $N_s$ be the length of the sequence until the first Success. This is a random integer. Then we have $$ \\Pr (N_s=k) = \\Pr(\\underbrace{FF\\cdots F}_{k-1}\\ S) = \\underbrace{(1-p)(1-p)\\cdots(1-p)}_{k-1}\\ p=(1-p)^{k-1}p=pq^{k-1}, $$ where $q=1-p$ and $k\\ge1$. This is called a Geometric Distribution, which is the discrete equivalent of the Exponential Distribution. Random variables with these distributions are called memoryless. (See Ross, Introduction to Probability Models, 9th Edition, page 284.)\n\nThe expected value and variance of $N_s \\sim \\text{Geom}(p)$ are $$ \\text{E}{N_s(p)}=\\frac{1}{p}, \\text{ and } \\text{Var}{N_s(p)} = \\frac{1-p}{p^2}. $$Proof can be found in Ross, above. Note that $$\\text{E}{N_s(p)} = 1 +(1-p)\\text{E}{N_s(p)}, \\text{ whose solution is } \\frac{1}{p}.$$\n\nIn your case $p = \\frac{1}{6}\\,$ and so E(No. rolls) = 6, and Var(No. rolls) = 30 -- Geom$(\\frac{1}{6})$ has a long tail.\n\n\nOne \"trick\" that often lets you avoid issues of convergence when solving probability problems is to use a recursive argument.\n\nYou have a 1/6 probability of rolling a 6 right away, and a 5/6 chance of rolling something else and starting the process over (but with one additional roll under your belt).\n\nLet $E$ be the expected number of rolls before getting a 6; by the reasoning above, we have:\n\n$E = (1)(1/6) + (E + 1)(5/6)$\n\nSolving for $E$ yields $E = 6$.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use the generating function. The generating function $G(t)$ for a probability distribution that only takes on integer values is defined as:\n\n$G(t) = \\Sigma_{i = 0}^{\\infty} p_i t^i$\n\nThe reason the generating function comes in handy is that $G'(1)$ gives the expected value and $G''(1) + G'(1) - (G'(1))^2$ gives the variance; one can check this directly.\n\nIn our case, the generating function is:\n\n$G(t) = (1/6)t + (1/6)(5/6)t^2 + (1/6)(5/6)^2t^3 + \\ldots$\n\nWe can rewrite this as follows:\n\n$G(t) = (1/5)(5t/6 + (5t/6)^2 + (5t/6)^3 + \\ldots)$\n\nSumming the geometric series gives $G(t) = t/(6-5t)$; from here, we can calculate $G'(t)$ and $G''(t)$, plug in $t = 1$, and use the above expressions to extract both the expected value and the variance (6 and 30, respectively).\n\n\nElliott's answer is surely the nicest. To sum the series, we can use a method similar to the geometric series.\n\nLet $$S = 1 + 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) + 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 + \\cdots $$\n\n\n$$\\frac{5}{6}S = \\frac{5}{6} + 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 + 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 + \\cdots $$\n\n$$S - \\frac{5}{6}S = 1+ \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) +\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 + \\cdots $$\n\nThis is just a geometric series and hence we have that\n\n$$S = 36$$\n\nNow we have that $$\\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^n (n+1) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot S = 6,$$ as expected.\n\n(Convergence of the series can be seen by the ratio test)\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Very nice. It's great to see so many different ways to find the convergence value for power series. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0jeremy radcliff Jan 25 '17 at 21:12\n\nHere's an intuitive argument. Roll the die $6000$ times. You'd expect there to be $1000$ 6's among them. Consider the gaps between successive 6's in the list (plus the initial gap to the first 6). These lengths are the values of independent draws from a geometric RV with $p=1/6$, so the average gap length is the expected value you want.\n\nThe sum of these (~1000) gap lengths is 6000, and so the average gap is $6000/1000=6$ (modulo a little fudge at the end which would go to $0$ by making the string longer).\n\n\nI'm late to the party, but here's a slightly different path to the same solution. Let $X$ be the number of die rolls until we roll a specific number. Let $p$ be the probability that we roll the specific number and $q = 1-p$ be the probability that we roll any of the other numbers. We know\n\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X] \\triangleq 1p + 2qp + 3q^2 p + 4q^3p + \\dots $$\n\nNote that the geometric series $\\sum_{x=1}^{\\infty} q^x = \\frac{q}{1-q}$. Using this fact and a little algebra and calculus, we get,\n\n$$ \\begin{align} \\mathbb{E}[X] &= 1p + 2qp + 3q^2 p + 4q^3p + \\dots \\\\ &= \\sum_{x = 0}^{\\infty} (x + 1) q^x p \\\\ &= \\sum_{x = 1}^{\\infty} x q^{x-1} p \\\\ &= \\sum_{x = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} q^x p \\\\ &= p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} \\Big( \\sum_{x = 1}^{\\infty} q^x \\Big) \\\\ &= p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} \\Big( \\frac{q}{1-q} \\Big) \\\\ &= p \\frac{1}{(1 - q)^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\frac{1}{6}}{\\big(1 - \\frac{5}{6}\\big)^2} \\\\ &= 6 \\end{align} $$\n\n\nYour Answer"}

The explanation of Anton is of course correct but there exist stronder statements in the literature: for example by Sinjukov (Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR (N.S.) 98, (1954) 21--23) any symmetric space is locally \\emph{geodesically rigid} is the sense that any other metric having the same (unparameterized) geodesics with it is affinely equivalent to if (i.e., the Levi-Civita connections coincide) which in the irreducible case means that the metrics are proportional.\n\nActually, stronger statements hold. For example from the Lichnerowicz-Obata conjecture arXiv:math/0407337 it follows that compact Riemannian homogeneous metrics such that sectional curvature is not constant and positive are also geodesically rigid. Indeed, a Killing vector field for the initial metric is a infinitesimal projective transformation for the second, which must be also Killing by the projective Lichnerowicz-Obata conjecture. Then, the isometry algebras of the metrics are the same and therefore their volume forms are the same and these already implies (short tensor calculations, see for examples eqns. (1), (4), (5) of arXiv:0806.3169) that the metrics are affinely equivalent. I do not know whether homogeneous metrics of nonconstant curvature are geodesically rigid locally but all examples indicate that probably they are.\n\nNow, in the case your metric is K\u00e4hler and not flat,\nthen if it is not geodesically rigid then it is locally a cone over a (sasakian) manifold which in particular implies that the manifold is not compact. This statement is pretty nontrivial and follows from Theorem 4.6. of Mikes (Journal of Mathematical Sciences 78(1996) 311-333) combined with the Splitting Lemma from arXiv:0904.0535 and combined with the following statement which was explained to me by Kiosak and which is probably not published: Warped product K\u00e4hler nonflat metric is a locally a cone over a sasakian manifold.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ In the question there is no connected Lie group, no infitesimal projective transformations.

Both solutions are based on preprocessing and have complexity $O(n^2 + |Q|)$ where $Q$ is the set of queries. The second solution runs in $O(n + |Q|)$ if all queries have the same width.\n\nSolution 1 - Preprocess all unique queries\n\nIterate over the suffixes of $S$. For each suffix $S_i=S[i..n]$, build the suffix tree of $S_i$ with Ukkonen's algorithm. After update $j$ to the current suffix tree, store the tree size in a matrix at position $(i,i+j-1)$. A query for the range $[x,y]$ is answered by the matrix element at $(x,y)$.\n\nSuffix tree size can be stored along with the suffix tree and updated in constant time at each step by modifying the update procedure in Ukkonen's algorithm. For each update the size increases by the current number of leaves.\n\nSolution 2 - Preprocess unique query widths\n\nThis solution is harder to implement but requires less preprocessing work if there are few query widths. Preprocessing takes $O(n)$ time if there is only one query width.\n\nFor each query width $w$, use a sliding window of width $w$ and incrementally build a suffix tree. Remove the suffix starting one character to the left of the window by remove the longest suffix from the tree. At each step, the current number of substrings within the sliding window is the tree size.\n\nAll queries can then be answered in linear time by using the results of the precomputation.\n\nNote: removing the longest suffix can be done by removing the oldest leaf of the suffix tree. It is not easy to implement correctly.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ This seems to be a bit off. The task is not to answer all possible $O(n^2)$ queries, but to answer some $q$ given queries. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Gassa Jul 4 '18 at 11:17\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I answered the question for the general case, which was the point of the question. In the special case where the number of queries is low, the solution proposed by the question author would run faster in practice. The number of outputs of a valid solution is $q$, which is of size $O(n^2)$ (disregarding duplicate queries), so any possible solution must run in $O(n^2)$ or slower. My proposed solution takes time $O(n^2)$ for preprocessing and then each query can be answered in constant time. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0user11171 Jul 4 '18 at 15:10\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Again, $q$ is a parameter.

I'd bet $n$ and $q$ are independent parameters from $1$ to $100\\,000$ or so, and the time limit is a couple of seconds, so that an $O(nq)$ solution times out, but something better like $O(n \\sqrt q)$ doesn't. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Gassa Jul 4 '18 at 15:51\n\nThere is $O(n \\sqrt{n} + |Q| \\sqrt{n})$ offline solution.\n\n  1.

Note that you can use an indirection layer to avoid modifications to the original suffix tree.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ The number of distinct substrings is the number of paths in the suffix tree that start at the root and end at a node with just a single leaf below it, correct?

I believe that Shelah's theorem, from his 1971 paper \"The number of non-isomorphic models of an unstable first-order theory\" (Israel J. of Math) answers your question about real closed fields in the positive.\n\nThe best big result on such questions that I know of is in the 2000 Annals paper \"The uncountable spectra of countable theories.\" by Hart, Hrushovski, Laskowski.\n\nTo answer the question on real closed fields specifically (and somewhat cautiously since I'm not a model-theorist):\n\nThe theory of real closed fields is a complete first order theory, with countable language. It is an unstable (an easy fact, I think, and explained better on wikipedia than I could explain) theory as well. Hence Shelah's result applies, and the bound $2^\\kappa$ is realized as you surmised.\n\nBonus points should go to Shelah (and perhaps also to Hart, Hrushovski, Laskowski, whose paper mentions the result of Shelah and proves other things) for proving that this bound is realized (for uncountable cardinals), except for theories $T$ which have all of the following properties:\n\n  1. $T$ has infinite models.\n  2. $T$ is superstable.\n  3. $T$ has prime models over pairs.\n  4. $T$ does not have the dimensional order property.\n\nI have no clue what the fourth property means. But there are plenty of non-superstable theories to which Shelah's theorem applies, and hence which realize your bound (for uncountable cardinals).\n\nFor countable cardinality, I think there are still some open problems about how many non-isomorphic models there can be of a given theory, with cardinality $\\aleph_0$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nHi, Marty.

(Your question about transcendental Galois theory is still on my mind too) \u2013\u00a0 Marty Jan 27 '10 at 1:12\n+1: As a model theorist who is familiar with Shelah's work in this area, I can assure you that this is correct: Shelah's result gives you that this theory has the maximal number of models in any uncountable cardinality. This is simply because the theory is unstable, since any model is infinite and has a definable strict linear ordering on the universe (unstability is actually a somewhat more general condition than this). Shelah's theorem cannot apply to the countable models -- consider the theory of the linear ordering on the rational numbers, which is aleph-0-categorical, yet unstable. \u2013\u00a0 John Goodrick Jan 27 '10 at 2:59\n... also, Shelah's theorem is only about theories in a countable language (which is no problem for this example, of course). Theories in uncountable languages are still mysterious to us. \u2013\u00a0 John Goodrick Jan 27 '10 at 3:00\nAs for the number of countable models, there is really only one open question left (at least for countable theories), which is Vaught's Conjecture: if there are uncountably many countable models, then there are 2^(aleph_0) countable models (i.e. the maximum number). This is still wide open. \u2013\u00a0 John Goodrick Jan 27 '10 at 3:04\nshow 1 more comment\n\nFor real closed fields this is fairly easy.\n\nFirst show that for any infinite cardinal k there are 2^k nonisomorphic linear orders of cardinality k\n\nFor example if X is a subset of k let A_x be Q+2+Q if x is in k and Q+3+Q if x is not in X. Let L_X be the sum of the A_x for x in k. It is easy to see that L_X is isomorphic to L_Y if and only if X=Y.\n\nIf F is a real closed and x and y are infinite element of R we say that x and y are comparable if and only if there are natural numbers m and n such that x is less than y^m and y is less than x^n. The ordering of R induces a linear order L_R of the comparability classes, which we call the ladder of R.\n\nSuppose L is a linear order. Let F be the real algebraic numbers. Let R_L be the real closure of the transcendental extension of the real algebraic numbers F(x_l:l\\in L) ordered such that if i is less than j then x_i^n is less than x_j for all n. It's not hard to show that the ladder of R_L is isomorphic to L.\n\nThus if we start with nonisomorphic orders A and B then the fields R_A and R_B will be nonisomorphic.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nDave, welcome to MO!

Clark May 5 '10 at 2:27\nadd comment\n\nIn the countable case, the bound of 2\u03c9 is realized, since any countable real-closed field will contain the rational numbers and fill at most countably many cuts in the rationals with LUBs. But we can arrange that any given cut is filled by a real closed subfield of R containing that real. So there must be 2\u03c9 many non-isomorphic countaable real closed fields.\n\nIn the general case, because the models have an order, you can easily make this order have different cofinalities, by building elementary chains of different lengths. That is, just use your Lowenheim Skolem construction to add another point on top of the previous model, and continue for \u03b4 steps. This will produce an elementary extension of size \u03ba whose order has cofinality \u03b4, for any regular \u03b4 up to \u03ba. So this gives many more models, but doesn't quite answer your 2\u03ba question. I'm inclined to agree with you and expect that it must be the maximal number for all \u03ba on general grounds.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nAlthough Marty has answered the question in full, I thought I'd remark that Joel's argument generalizes easily to give 2^k for any k <= 2^{aleph_0}. Namely, choose a transcendence basis B for R over Q, and for each subset S of B with |S|=k, let F_S be the set of real numbers that are algebraic over Q(S). This gives you 2^k real closed fields, and they are all different. \u2013\u00a0 Bjorn Poonen Jan 26 '10 at 3:00\nThanks, Bjorn, that's helpful -- in particular, that's enough to derive the statement about Aut(C) in my question. \u2013\u00a0 Pete L.

The proof of Shelah's theorem that I've read involves building a big class of Ehrenfeucht-Mosowski models over carefully chosen indiscernible sequences, and then using and extremely clever and indirect argument to show that some subcollection of 2^k of these models must be pairwise nonisomorphic. \u2013\u00a0 John Goodrick Jan 27 '10 at 3:17\nshow 3 more comments\n\nYour Answer"}

Then\n\n$$\\|Tf\\|_1=\\int_0^1 \\left|\\int^t_0 f(s) ds\\right| dt \\le \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 |f(s)| ds dt = \\|f\\|_1$$\n\nThis shows $\\|T\\|\\le 1$. Setting $f_n(x)=n\\chi_{[0,1/n]}(x)$, we see $||f_n||_1=1$. Note that\n\n$$\\int^t_0 n\\chi_{[0,1/n]}(s) ds=\\left\\{\\begin{array}\\,1 & \\text{if}\\;t\\ge1/n\\\\ nt & \\text{if}\\;t<1/n\\end{array}\\right.$$ It follows that $$||Tf_n||_1=\\int^1_0\\int_0^t n\\chi_{[0,1/n]}(s)ds dt=\\int_0^{1/n}nt\\,dt+\\int_{1/n}^1 1\\,dt =1-\\frac{1}{2n}\\rightarrow 1\\;\\text{as}\\;n\\rightarrow\\infty. $$ Hence $||T||=1$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nFor $f \\equiv 1$, I found $||Tf||_1=1/2$ and not $1$. Otherwise, $f(x)=e^x$ works. \u2013\u00a0 Seirios Oct 15 '12 at 16:46\nThanks for the answers! But by the definition of the norm of T as $\\Vert T \\Vert = \\sup_ {f \\in L^1[0,1],\\Vert f\\Vert_1=1} \\Vert Tf \\Vert_1$, I can't really see how $f=2$ works, nor can I see that using $f=e^x$ will work, since $\\Vert f \\Vert _1 \\neq 1$ for both of these cases. Is the definition I'm using wrong? \u2013\u00a0 Maethor Oct 15 '12 at 20:17\nWhat makes you think that your simple-minded estimate is anywhere near sharp? If you do just one step in your computation, you get $$ \\int_{0}^{1}\\left\\lvert\\int_{0}^t f(x)\\,dt\\right\\rvert\\,dx \\leq \\int_{0}^1 \\int_{0}^t \\lvert f(x)\\rvert\\,dx\\,dt $$ which is an integral over a triangular region. If you brutally replace $t$ by $1$ here, you will get an integral over a square, so your estimate will overshoot badly. I would suggest to think about $F(t) = \\int_{0}^t f(x)\\,dx$ and think about what differential equation it solves. You should get $2/\\pi$ as a final solution, unless I'm mistaken. \u2013\u00a0 commenter Oct 16 '12 at 2:27\n@Norbert: geeez, you're right...

This sequence will minimize the effect of charging the upper right triangle in your estimate and a computation shows that $\\lVert Tf_n\\rVert_{1} \\nearrow 1$. \u2013\u00a0 commenter Oct 16 '12 at 11:40\n@MattN. The operator $T$ is the Volterra operator. The trick to compute its norm in $L^2$ is to consider $S = T^\\ast T$. Then $\\lVert T\\rVert^2 = \\lVert T^\\ast T\\rVert$. Use that $S$ is compact and self-adjoint, so its norm is equal to its maximal eigenvalue. An eigenfunction $\\lambda f = T^\\ast T f$ is a solution to $f'' = - \\lambda f$ and this yields an ansatz that lets you compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $S$ and thus its norm. \u2013\u00a0 commenter Oct 16 '12 at 13:22\nshow 18 more comments\n\nYour Answer"}

Energy = power x time. So your 12V battery of 150Ah needs 1800Wh of energy (12 x 150). So a 25W PV panel would need 72 hours at full output (1800Wh/25W).\n\nThe equation is: Peak-hours required = $\\frac{V_{batt} \\times capacity_{batt}}{Power_{PV}} $\n\nThat's an unusual combination of quite a small panel and a very big battery - is the battery designed to be a multi-week store for a low-power system, by any chance?\n\nFor a more accurate answer, you need a lot more information.\n\nThe output of the panel at any moment will depend on:\n\n(1) the voltage, (which will be determined by the battery, and will change as the battery charges)\n\n(2) the ambient temperature, and\n\n(3) the amount light hitting the panel. The amount of light hitting the panel will depend on panel tilt, orientation, overshading, weather, altitude, location, time of year, time of day.\n\nFor (1), you need the panel IV curve, typically presented on the manufacturer's datasheet. That datasheet will also tell you how output varies with panel temperature. You can then estimate the panel's temperature from the ambient temperature - it will (to the first order) be a fairly steady amount above ambient.\n\nHere are some example power curves for a 12V PV (and it looks like it's approx 125W peak) panel, from altestore.com :\n\nPV panel I-V curve\n\nYou also need to know about the battery's characteristics as it charges: the heat losses, and how its voltage changes with temperature and % charged. In a more complex system that involves a controller too, you'd need to know how the controller behaves, how it tracks the maximum power point, and what its internal losses are. A controller is very desirable, not only because it will track the PV panel's maximum power point, but also because it will prevent the battery over-charging.\n\nThere are various online PV calculators that will combine some of this information to give you estimates of output, such as the US NREL PVWATTS calculator. And there are free online GIS insolation resources to give you the raw source information to do detailed calculations yourself, such as the EU PVGIS database.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI think it's the combination of biggest standard pickup/SUV battery and largest (cheap) battery top-up solar panel \u2013\u00a0 Martin Beckett Aug 3 '11 at 4:23\nadd comment\n\n150 Amper*hour is the battery charge capacity. With power of 25 Watt = 25 A*V at V = 12 V you will supply 25/12 Coulomb each second (Amper*s). So the charge time is equal to 150/(25/12) = 72 hours.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nIn the simplest case, and some unmentioned assumptions, the minimum charging time would be given by the formula already mentioned: $$ T = \\frac{V \\times Ah}{W}$$ this gives 12x150/25 = 72 hours.\n\nHowever, this case makes at least two major assumptions, the battery is fully discharged and there are no losses of any kind!\n\nIn the real world, the battery will not be fully discharged and there are energy losses \"everywhere.\" Just to drive the point home, if the battery is already charged, then the time would be zero.\n\nA typical 12V battery is considered \"discharged\" when its voltage is reduced to 9V. This means it has lost only 1/4 of its energy. Everything else remaining the same, it would only need 1/4 of the time (18 hrs) to charge up. If we assume 50% efficiency, this would bring the time up to 36 hours. Assuming 8 hrs per day of sunshine, it would take about 4 days.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYou need to know the implication of using a 25W panel, for me that is pretty small. The idea is 150Ah at 12 V (DC) we need to apply the 10hr charging method, so 10% of 150Ah gives 15A.$$\\frac{150\\,\\text{Ah}}{10\\,\\text h}=15\\,\\text A$$\n\nSo power of needed solar panel is computed as follows, $12\\,\\text V\\cdot15\\,\\text A=180\\,\\text W$. So the power of your panel is 180 W.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThe 10% of 150ah is 15ah. \u2013\u00a0 jinawee Feb 2 at 12:48\nadd comment\n\nprotected by Qmechanic Apr 11 at 14:32\n\n\nWould you like to answer one of these unanswered questions instead?"}

Then find values of $u$ with $w/2<u<w$ and $uw|n$. Then set $k=n/uw$ and you have your triple $(k,u,w)$ from which you can compute an $(a,b,c)$.\n\n(If you want to allow $ab=0$, the change the above to $u\\leq w < 2u$.

Before Brian pointed out that it was a duplicate, I came up with a solution different from the shortlist solution. (I treat the problem of emptying one of the piles, which, as discussed in Phira's answer and comments, is equivalent.)\n\nThe idea is to successively produce $0$s in the binary representations of two of the numbers, starting with the least significant bit. So assume that the last $k$ bits of $b$ and $c$ are already zero; then if neither $b$ nor $c$ is zero yet, our aim is to make the last $k+1$ bits of two of the numbers zero.\n\nSo consider the $(k+1)$-th bits of $b$ and $c$. If they're both $0$, we're done. If they're both $1$, we just need one transfer between $b$ and $c$ to make them both $0$. If one is $0$ and one is $1$, we can put the $1$ in the lesser of the two by transferring from the greater to the lesser until it becomes the lesser.\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume $b\\lt c$. Now there are two cases. If $a\\ge b$, we can get rid of the $1$ by a transfer from $a$ to $b$. Otherwise, $a\\lt b\\lt c$, and we transfer first from $b$ to $a$ and then from $c$ to $b$, thus going from $a,b,c$ to $2a,b-a,c$ to $2a,2(b-a),c+a-b$. Now the sum of the first two numbers is $2b$, which has $0$s in the last $k+1$ bits, so we can make the last $k+1$ bits of those two numbers $0$ by making transfers between them, each of which gets rid of their last $1$ bits.\n\nIf we initially assign $a$, $b$ and $c$ such that $a$ has the fewest final zeros, this strategy seems to be slightly more efficient than the shortlist strategy: Compared to the total of $103505$ transfers minimally required to solve all distinct instances with totals less than $100$, this strategy makes $172865$ transfers while the shortlist strategy makes $190994$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThe $2b$ trick is nice.

How do you get r alone?  Thanks for your help!\n\nDate: 06/16/2006 at 10:17:55\nFrom: Doctor Peterson\nSubject: Re: What is this formula used for?\n\nHi, Debbie.\n\nFirst, you don't need to even ask what a formula is for in this sort \nof problem.  One of the most important things about algebra (or math \nin general, really) is that it is abstract: that is, we can take all \nsorts of real-world problems and turn them into math problems (such \nas equations to solve), and once you've done that, it doesn't matter \nat all where they came from.  The methods you use in algebra ignore \nthe meaning of the problem, and just look at the equation itself.\n\nMany equations you'll work with in class don't come from anywhere at \nall; you are just practicing techniques that you can use on problems \nthat do have some real-world meaning.  It's sort of like a medical \nstudent practicing an operation on a dummy; he doesn't have to ask \nabout the patient's family or insurance!  But when he gets into real \nmedicine, all those things will matter.  In this case, the equation \nMIGHT relate to interest on a bank account, with r being the interest \nrate; but the same equation could come from other sorts of problems, \ntoo--or none at all.\n\nNow, to solve this equation for r, the important thing is to make \nsure that at each step you are making a new equation that is still \ntrue--that is, an equivalent equation.  We know that if we do the \nsame thing to each side, e.g. adding the same thing, the new equation \nwill be equivalent.  But often students don't pay close attention to \nwhat they are doing, and they don't really make an equivalent \n\nLook closely at what you did:\n\n      M = C(1 + r)\n     -C  -C\n  M - C =  (1 + r)\n\nWhat you say you are doing is subtracting C from both sides.  But \nthat's not really what you did.  When you do the subtraction (without \nsimplifying anything), you actually get\n\n  M - C = C(1 + r) - C\n\nNow you have to simplify, and you can't just cross off the C's!  If we \nexpand C(1 + r) using the distributive property, we get\n\n  M - C = C + Cr - C\n\nand then combining like terms gives\n\n  M - C = Cr\n\nThat's not what you got!  Why?  Because you didn't actually subtract C \nfrom the right side, but just crossed something off, thinking it was \nthe right thing to do.  This is a very common mistake!  You must \nalways think of the subtraction as making a change to the equation and \nthen simplifying, not just as canceling something.\n\nWe can continue, now--even though what you did is not the recommended\nmethod, which I will get to in a minute.  Look at the equation we have \n\n  M - C = Cr\n\nWhat is our goal?  To get r by itself.  We're almost there; all that's \n\"wrong\" with this is that r is multiplied by C, and we can get rid of\nthat by dividing by C.  So let's divide BOTH SIDES by C, again making \nsure that's really what we do:\n\n  M - C   Cr\n  ----- = --\n    C     C\n\nNow we can simplify the right side; multiplying r by C and then \ndividing by C undoes the multiplication and just leaves r:\n\n  M - C\n  ----- = r\n\nAnd that's our answer!\n\nNow, there are two other methods that make the first step easier than \nwhat we ended up doing.  One is to always simplify both sides of an \nequation before we start solving:\n\n  M = C(1 + r)\n\n  M = C + Cr\n\n(I distributed on the right side.)\n\nNow we want to get r alone; on the right side it is FIRST being \nmultiplied by C (remember the order of operations?) and THEN we're \nadding C to it.  To get it by itself, we have to undo both operations; \nand we do that in reverse order.  (For example, in the morning I put \non my socks first, then my shoes; to undo that at night, I take off \nmy shoes first, then my socks.)  So we'll first undo the addition of \nC, by subtracting C from both sides:\n\n    M   =   C + Cr\n  - C     - C\n  M - C =       Cr\n\nWhat this really means is that we are subtracting C from both sides \nlike this:\n\n  M - C = C + Cr - C = Cr\n\nwhere I simplified the right side by combining the like terms C and \n\nNow we're right where we were in the first method, and just have to \ndivide by C to finish.\n\nThere's another way we could have done this, without simplifying \nfirst; we'd look at the equation as given and see that in\n\n  M = C(1 + r)\n\nwe are FIRST adding 1 to r, and THEN multiplying by C.  We can undo \nthat by FIRST dividing both sides by C, and THEN subtracting 1 from \nboth sides.  The answer we get would look different, but would mean \nthe same thing.  If you wish, you may try doing that; but the method \nI've shown is what is usually taught.  I mention it because it is \nclose to what you tried to do: you wanted to get rid of the C first; \nbut because it is being MULTIPLIED rather than added, you have to \nDIVIDE by it rather than subtract, in order to eliminate it.  What you \nreally did was to subtract C from the left side and divide by C on \nthe right, which didn't give an equivalent equation.\n\n\n- Doctor Peterson, The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nMiddle School Equations\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM\n\u00a9 1994-2013 The Math Forum"}

Therefore, each unit has a mean duty\ncycle of 12168 hours, of which 12000 are spent in the field and 168\nare spent in the shop.\n\nThe periods in the shop are random and uncorrelated for each of the \n10 units.  The probability of any particular unit being in the shop \nat a randomly chosen instant is just p = 168/12168.  The probability\nof two specific units being in the shop at a random instant is p^2.\nIn general, the probability of exactly k out of 10 units being in the\nshop at a given instant is \n              Pr{k}  =   ----------  p^k (1-p)^(10-k)\n                         (10-k)! k!\n\nso the probability of finding exactly 2 units in the shop is 0.007675,\nwhereas the probability of TWO OR MORE in the shop is 0.007970.\n\nOf course, the above analysis makes several tacit assumptions, and in\nreality the probability could be significantly higher or lower, for \nany of several reasons.  For example, we didn't specify that all the\noperational periods were independent and uniformly distributed over\nthe year, so it's possible that all the units are operational for the \nsame 2-month period each year, which would increase the probability of\nhaving two in the shop at some point during the \"busy season\".  On the \nother hand, the real probability could also be much smaller.  Strictly \nspeaking, within the stated conditions of the original problem, the \nprobability of two or more units in the shop simultaneously could be \nanything from 0 to about 0.3874.  For example, if each unit operates \nfor EXACTLY 2000 hours between failures, we could stagger their repair \ncycles so that one fails every 200 hours, which is greater than the \none week repair time of 168 hours.  Thus, the probability of two in \nthe shop would be 0.  (One could also manipulate the probability by \nassuming the units operate in more or less mutually exclusive 2-month \nperiods during the year.)\n\nOn the other hand, if the units are operated in synchronized pairs\n(hopefully not two engines of a twin-engine airplane), and each fails\nevery 2000 hours exactly, then each pair is in the shop for 168 hours\nout of every 2168 hours, giving a probability of 0.0774.  If the five\npairs of units are staggerred, then the fraction of [active] time with\ntwo units in the shop would be 0.3874.\n\nIt might be interesting to figue out the maximum probability that\nwould be strictly consistent with the stated conditions of the\nproblem.  In many casually-stated probability problems it turns out\nthe answer can be anything on the interval from 0 to 1 (inclusive).\n\nReturn to MathPages Main Menu"}

Let $G$ be an $n \\times n$ bipartite graph. Define $G'$ to be equivalent to $G$, if $G'$ can be obtained from $G$ by complementing the neighbourhoods of some vertices in $[n_r]$.

For any $n \\times n$ bipartite graph $G$, at most $2^n-n$ members of $[G]$ have a perfect matching.\n\nProof. For each $i \\in [n]_c$ there is a graph $G^i \\in [G]$ such that $i \\in [n_c]$ has degree 0 in $G^i$. Just pick the vertices in $[n]_r$ that are adjacent to $i$ in $G$ and complement their neighbourhoods. If all $G^i$ are distinct, then the lemma clearly follows. Otherwise, $G^i=G^j$ for some $i \\neq j$. Thus, both $i$ and $j$ have degree 0 in $G^i$.

So, there are at least $n$ forbidden diagonals.

How much of the $0.65 seed does the dealer need to make a $0.55 \nper pound blend?\n\nThank you so very much for your help. Hope to hear from you soon.\n\nDate: 09/27/98 at 01:22:14\nFrom: Doctor Ken\nSubject: Re: Grass seed problem\n\n\nFirst I'll give you a sort of intuition-based solution, and then I'll \ngo back and be a little more formal, writing things out in algebraic \n\nThe first thing I noticed about this problem was that a pound of one \nkind of seed costs 45 cents, a pound of the other costs 65 cents, and \nwe want to make a mix that costs 55 cents. Well, 55 is halfway between \n45 and 65, so it seems like we should combine equal parts of the two \nkinds of seed. Since we need to use 200 pounds of the first kind, we \nshould use 200 pounds of the other kind, for a total of 400 pounds.  \n\nTo verify this solution, let's see how much the pieces would cost.  \n200 pounds of the first kind of seed would cost 200 * $0.45 = $90, and \n200 pounds of the second kind of seed would cost 200 * $0.65 = $130.  \nWe bought 400 pounds total and paid $220, so we paid on average \n$220/400 = $0.55. Seems to check out.\n\nNow, how can we use algebra to find this same solution? The first \nthing I usually try to do is to find a sentence (an English sentence, \nor whatever language you like best) that says something true and \nuseful about the problem. Then I translate that sentence into an \nalgebraic equation.  \n\nIn this problem, I think I'd make this sentence: \"The cost per pound \nof the combined seed mixture is 55 cents.\" Let's work on translating \nthat into an equation. First it becomes:\n\n   cost per pound = $0.55\n\nWhat is the cost per pound? It's the number you get when you divide \nthe total price by the number of pounds of seed:\n\n     total price\n    pounds of seed\n\nThe total price is the cost of the 45c part and the 65c part. The \nnumber of pounds of seed is the number of pounds of the first kind \nplus the number of pounds of the second kind. The only unknown thing \nhere is the number of pounds of the second kind, so let's call that x.\n\n    200*$0.45 + x*$0.65\n         200 + x\n\nNow we've done the translation. I'll leave it to you to work out the \nsolution from here, and verify that the answer really is 200.\n\n- Doctor Ken, The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nElementary Word Problems\nMiddle School Algebra\nMiddle School Word Problems\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM\n\u00a9 1994-2013 The Math Forum"}

Then the factor-group is not Hopfian, its factor by the (finite) subgroup generated by $t^{-2}$ is Hopfian. If one then kills $t^{-1}$ as well, one get a non-Hopfian group again. I hope he himself will explain here the Hopfian property of these groups. \u2013\u00a0 Mark Sapir Mar 29 '11 at 4:05\nThat is a very nice example. But how does one show that killing $t^{-2}$ gives a Hopfian group? I doubt that this quotient is residually finite. \u2013\u00a0 Andreas Thom Mar 30 '11 at 14:24\n\nEdit: this post refers to a group constructed here (see 5.10), which is Abels' group over the ring $\\mathbf{F}_p[t,1/t]$, and which probably provides a negative answer to the question. Thus the group $G$ below refers to the group of matrices\n\n$$\\left(\\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 & u_{12} & u_{13} & u_{14}\\newline 0 & d_{22} & u_{23} & u_{24}\\newline 0 & 0 & d_{33} & u_{34}\\newline 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\newline \\end{array}\\right) $$ where $u_{ij}\\in\\mathbf{F}_p[t,1/t]$,\n\nand $d_{ii}\\in\\mathbf{F}_p[t,1/t]^\\times=\\langle t\\rangle\\mathbf{F}_p^\\times$.\n\nActually I restrict to $d_{ii}\\in\\langle t\\rangle$ but it's not important. [end edit]\n\nI haven't checked but here are some guidelines to show the group is Hopfian.\n\nWrite the original group (given by $4\\times 4$ triangular matrices) as $G=D\\ltimes U$ with $D=\\mathbf{Z}^2$ and $U$ its unipotent part. Set $U^2=[U,U]$ and $U^3=[U,U^2]$, which is central and naturally isomorphic to $F_p[t,1/t]$. Our group is $H=G/M$, where $M\\subset U^3$ is generated by $F_p[t]$ and $t^{-2}$. Let $f$ be a surjective endomorphism of $H$.\n\n1) check that the center of $G$ is precisely $U^3$. It follows that $f$ induces a surjective endomorphism of $G/U^3$. Since this group is linear, it is Hopfian so this is an automorphism of $G/U^3$.\n\n2) Describe the group of automorphisms of $G/U^2 = \\mathbf{Z}^2\\ltimes F_p[t,1/t]^3$. (It should be reasonably easy to describe).\n\n3) Deduce a description of the group of automorphisms of $G/U^3$, or at least describe how these automorphisms act on $U^2/U^3$, showing that modulo something, the coefficient $12$ is multiplied by a monomial $w\\cdot t^a$ ($w\\in F_p*$) and the coefficient $24$ is multiplied by $vt^b$. So, taking a commutator (that should kill the \"modulo something\"), we obtain that in the action of $f$ on $H$, the coefficient $14$ should be multiplied by a monomial. This multiplication should stabilize $M$ so this is multiplication by a scalar in $F_p*$, which implies that f is actually an automorphism.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI just edited tex by inserting dollar signs etc. \u2013\u00a0 Igor Belegradek Apr 2 '11 at 23:11\nSorry if I missed something, but doesn't conjugation by $diag(t^2,1,1,1)$ define an automorphism of $G$ that sends $M$ strictly inside itself (implying $G/M$ non-Hopfian)? \u2013\u00a0 BS. Jul 22 '12 at 16:58\nOn the other hand, a similar idea might work : take $N=F_p[t^2]$ and $M=<N,t^{-1}$. Then $G/N$ is non-Hopfian, but since no non-trivial translation of $\\mathbb{Z}$ sends $E={-1,0,2,4,...,2k,...}$ (strictly) inside itself, the conjugation counterexample breaks down and your argument might work. \u2013\u00a0 BS.

So do you recon that I would be able to half or maybe even third the heating due to it not beening infinet dilution woukld you be able to hazard a guess with a vague explanation, if not it doesn't matter too much all I need to do is put in my report that I presume that it is infinet dissolution, its just that I dont want to be using more cooling than I sholud as I have to do a detailed costing on the system.\n\nOne other thing I also found the heat of dissolution to be 800kJ/mol, but that was on, or however it's spelt, so it's probaly not reliable.\n\nThanks loads.\nApr16-07, 05:30 AM\nP: 20\nI'm just looking for a basic temperature rise, the whole system is an absorption tower, a wet gas feed at the bottom, and the acid feed at top, so somehow I'm also going to have to come up with a compromise of the two phases increasing with temperature due to the dissolution and the general heat transfere between the two counter flows as both streams will rise in temperature but flow past the inlet streams as they exit which will be at the original lower temperature, but I'm probaly just going to say and presume there is no heat transfer from counter flows but that both the acid and gas are heated together to the same temperature, ha lazy....!\nApr16-07, 01:32 PM\nP: 20\nhi, would you not also have to take into consideration the heating of the gas via the acid (heat transfer), I have a spread sheet set up which considers this and as the gas flow rate is many time the liquid flow rate, and whole system only reaches 55.65oC, and this is good as the column works at optimum absorption at 55-60oC. This is assuming that the heat is shared equally let me know what you think of this if you think its a bad idea then I scrap it, thanks\nApr16-07, 07:06 PM\nP: 116\nSo you spray HS2O4 above and you have some kind of gas at the bottom? Or is it air with water?\nAs for the 800 kJ/mol, that seems much! Meaning the reactor will even blow more up than I predicted. You should know exactly what you are doing here!!!\n\nThe thing is, I calculated that it's 18 M and the internet site also uses 18 M solution as an example. So the heat of reaction they use there should be correct.

Suppose $f(x)$ is any function which is both odd and even. Then $f(-x) = -f(x)$ by odd-ness, and $f(-x)=f(x)$ by even-ness.

But it is good to get one's hands dirty and compute.\n\nIf $20!$ seems dauntingly large, calculate $10!$. You will note it ends with two zeros. Multiplying $10!$ by all the numbers from $11$ to $20$ except $15$ and $20$ will not add to the zeros. Multiplying by $15$ and $20$ will add one zero each.\n\nRemark: Suppose that we want to find the number of terminal zeros in something seriously large, like $2048!$. It is not hard to see that this number is $N$, where $5^N$ is the largest power of $5$ that divides $2048!$. This is because we need a $5$ and a $2$ for every terminal $0$, and the $5$s are the scarcer resource.\n\nTo find $N$, it is helpful to think in terms of money. Every number $n$ between $1$ and $2048$ has to pay a $1$ dollar tax for every $5$ \"in it.\" So $45$ has to pay $1$ dollar, but $75$ has to pay $2$ dollars, because $75=5^2\\cdot 3$. And a $5$-rich person like $1250$ has to pay $4$ dollars.\n\nLet us gather the tax in stages. First, everybody divisible by $5$ pays a dollar. These are $5$, $10$, $15$ and so on up to $2045$, that is, $5\\cdot 1, 5\\cdot 2,\\dots, 5\\cdot 409$. So there are $409$ of them. It is useful to bring in the \"floor\" or \"greatest integer $\\le x$ \" function, and call the number of dollars gathered in the first stage $\\lfloor 2048/5\\rfloor$.\n\nBut many numbers still owe some tax, namely $25,50,75,\\dots,2025$. Get them to pay $1$ dollar each. These are the multiples of $25$, and there are $\\lfloor 2048/25\\rfloor$ of them.\n\nBut $125$, $250$, and so on still owe money. Get them to pay $1$ dollar each. We will gather $\\lfloor 2048/125\\rfloor$ dollars.\n\nBut $625$, $1250$, and $1875$ still owe money. Gather $1$ dollar from each, and we will get $\\lfloor 2048/625\\rfloor$ dollars.\n\nNow everybody has paid up, and we have gathered a total of $$\\lfloor 2048/5\\rfloor + \\lfloor 2048/25\\rfloor +\\lfloor 2048/125\\rfloor +\\lfloor 2048/625\\rfloor$$ dollars. That's the number of terminal zeros in $2048!$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI don't always upvote answers that are in \"competition\" with my own...but when I do, it's because it's a damn good answer!

Since we get a zero for every pair of factors $5\\cdot 2$, then the minimum of these will answer your question. More simply, $5$ happens less often as a factor (since it's bigger than $2$), so we need only count up the number of $5$'s. In particular, there's one each in $5,10,15,20$, so there are $4$ zeroes at the end.\n\nIf the problem had asked about $25!$, then there'd be $6$ zeroes--not $5$--because there are two factors of $5$ in $25$.

In the second paper on the webpage that Daniel linked to above, Bridson exhibits pairs of a group and a subgroup such that no algorithm can determine whether or not they have isomorphic profinite completions. Unfortunately, it may be impossible to compute a presentation for the subgroup. I discuss this sort of thing in my answer to this question: mathoverflow.net/questions/15957/\u2026 \u2013\u00a0 HJRW Feb 27 '10 at 2:19\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nOK, I think I have an example of two groups with the same profinitization and a computable property which distinguishes them. The point is that very fine detail about the commutator subgroups can't be seen in the profinitization.\n\nLet $q$ be prime and let $K$ be the $q$-th cyclotomic field. Choose $q$ such that the class group of $K$ is not trivial. Let $I$ be a trivial ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ and $J$ a nontrivial ideal. Our groups $G$ and $H$ will be $(\\mathbb{Z}/q) \\ltimes I$ and $(\\mathbb{Z}/q) \\ltimes J$.\n\nFor any group $B$, let $B' = [B,B]$ and $B'' = [B', B']$. Note that $B/B'$ acts on $B'/B''$ by conjugation. Our computable criterion is the following:\n\n$B/B' \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/q \\times \\mathbb{Z}/q =: A$, the action of the group ring $\\mathbb{Z}[A]$ on $B'/B''$ factors through a map $\\mathbb{Z}[A] \\to \\mathcal{O}_K$ and, as such, $B'/B''$ is a free $\\mathcal{O}_K$ module.\n\nWe leave it as an exercise that $G$ satisfies this condition and $H$ does not.\n\nI believe this condition should be computable. We can go from a finite presentation of $B$ to one of $B'$. (UPDATE I have revised this argument.) Abelianizations are computable, so we can check whether $B/B'$ has the right format. If it does, then $B'$ has finite index in $B$. I think we can use this to get a finite presentation of $B'$: Let $\\Delta$ be a two-dimensional $CW$-complex with one vertex, an edge for each generator of $B$ and a two cell for each relation. Let $\\Delta'$ be the cover of $B$ corresponding to $B'$. Since $B$ has finite index in $B'$, $\\Delta'$ will have finitely many cells, and we get a finite presentation of $B'$.\n\nWe can the compute the abelianization of $B'$ and, I think, the action of the abelianization of $B$ on that of $B'$ should be computable. Note that there are only $q^2$ maps from $\\mathbb{Z}[A]$ to $\\mathcal{O}_K$, so we can just check them each in turn. The class of a finite generated module for a Dedekind domain should be computable by standard number theory methods, although I admit I couldn't describe them.\n\nThe fact that these two groups have the same profinitization is relatively well known. Let $\\hat{I}$ and $\\hat{J}$ denote the profinite completions of $I$ and $J$. The profinite completions of $G$ and $H$ are $\\mathbb{Z}/n \\ltimes \\hat{I}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/n \\ltimes \\hat{J}$.\n\nWe can identify $\\hat{I}$ and $\\hat{J}$ with submodules of $\\mathbb{A}^0_K$, the integral adeles of $K$. Since $I$ and $J$ are locally principal, these are principal ideals in the ring $\\mathbb{A}^0_K$. They are thus equivalent as $\\mathbb{A}^0_K$ modules, and thus as $\\mathcal{O}_K$ modules.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThe commutator subgroup of a finitely presented group need not be a finitely presented group. For example, the commutator subgroup of the free group on 2 generators is not even finitely generated. \u2013\u00a0 Bjorn Poonen Feb 27 '10 at 15:17\nDavid, you're correct that a finite-index subgroup of a fp group is fp, so if the abelianization of B is finite and B is fp then B' is also fp. So why is your G fp? \u2013\u00a0 HJRW Feb 27 '10 at 23:50\nTo add a little bit: the first construction of a pair of non-isomorphic, fp, residually finite groups with isomorphic profinite completions was given by Bridson and Grunewald in 2004. Their construction is still essentially the only known one. Your groups seem to be obviously residually finite, so if they're fp then they this is very interesting. \u2013\u00a0 HJRW Feb 28 '10 at 0:05\n@Henry: A semidirect product of finitely presented groups is finitely presented. \u2013\u00a0 Bjorn Poonen Feb 28 '10 at 1:51\n@Henry: I think it was known <=1964 that there exist 2 residually finite fp groups with isomorphic profinite completions. If one starts with a smooth projective variety over a number field k, extends the base via two embeddings k --> C, and takes the fundamental group, then the two resulting groups are fp groups with isomorphic profinite completions (\u00e9tale fundamental group of V_kbar). In 1964 Serre gave an example in which these groups were not isomorphic. And if I remember correctly, they were residually finite. In fact, I think they were exactly the groups David has constructed. \u2013\u00a0 Bjorn Poonen Feb 28 '10 at 2:27\n\nIn this paper, Owen Cotton-Barratt and I construct two finitely presentable groups with isomorphic profinite completions, but such that one is conjugacy separable (implying solvable conjugacy problem) and the other has unsolvable conjugacy problem.\n\n(The construction is very much in the spirit of the paper of Bridson that Daniel Groves mentioned in the comments.)\n\n\nSorry, I only just noticed requirement 2. Since almost no properties are computable from a finite presentation, and yet the class of properties computable from a finite presentation is mysterious (eg does it include having a proper finite-index subgroup?), I don't see how you'll get any interesting answers with condition 2.\n\n\nAs Bjorn explained to me in the comments to David's answer, it's not nearly as hard as I had thought to build two fp groups with the same profinite completion. Indeed, there are virtually abelian examples. As one can solve the isomorphism problem for virtually abelian groups, it follows that there examples of computable properties that are not determined by the profinite completion, as David's answer shows.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nIs it decidable from a presentation whether or not a group is large, i.e. admits a homomorphism onto the nonabelian free group on two letters? This seems totally unlikely, and surely either Henry or Daniel would know, but I like the following theorem anyway, so I'll advertise. Lackenby showed (`Detecting large groups', GR/0702571) that largeness is a property of the profinite completion of discrete finitely presented groups.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nHuh, interesting! It's unknown whether this is decidable. It's equivalent to asking whether a group has a proper finite-index subgroup, as G has a proper finite-index subgroup if and only if G*G*G is large. \u2013\u00a0 HJRW Feb 27 '10 at 2:40\nBut how does this answer the question? For a negative answer, what is needed is a decidable property that doesn't respect the profinite completion. (And for a positive answer to the question, you need to grapple with the collection of all decidable properties.) \u2013\u00a0 Joel David Hamkins Feb 27 '10 at 14:36\nJoel, as far as I can tell, there are no genuinely interesting properties that are known to be computable. Indeed, I think 'largeness' is one of the few real candidates. So it's certainly relevant, even if it doesn't answer the question in the strictest sense. \u2013\u00a0 HJRW Feb 27 '10 at 16:42\nActually, what Stover asks is decidable, whether a group has a homomorphism to a free group, by a result of Razborov. The usual definition of large is that there is a finite-index subgroup which maps onto a (non-cyclic) free group, which is actually the condition that Marc shows is determined by the profinite completion. If there is a non-residually finite hyperbolic group, then I suspect the answer to the question is no. ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=755958 \u2013\u00a0 Ian Agol Feb 27 '10 at 23:26\nRight, good point, Ian.

Is there a better way to find the height of a $d-$ary heap?\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n2 Answers\n\nup vote 3 down vote accepted\n\nA path from the last node to the leaf would always be a longest path. This is because the last node is always at the lowest level in the heap. Now, assume the root is at level $0$. Then the number of nodes at a completely filled level $i$ would be $d^i$.\n\nLet level $k$ be the last completely filled level in the heap. So the number of nodes upto (and including) level $k$ is: $$\\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{k}d^i = \\frac{d^{k+1} - 1}{d - 1}$$\n\nNow, the last node - the $n^{th}$ node - can either be the last node at level $k$, or it can be in an incomplete level $k+1$. Taking care of these two cases, it can be seen that: $$\\frac{d^{k+1} - 1}{d - 1} \\le n < \\frac{d^{k+2} - 1}{d - 1}$$ $$\\Rightarrow k\\le \\log_d(n(d-1) + 1) - 1 < k+1$$\n\nNow, equality is only if the last node is the last leaf of level $k$, which also has distance $k$ from the root. If not, that is if there is a level $k+1$, then the $\\log$ term would not be an integer, and applying the ceiling operator would give the right height of $k+1$. Thus, if the last element of the array is at position $n$, the height of the heap is: $$h = \\lceil \\log_d(nd - n + 1) \\rceil - 1$$ You can change the base of the logarithm using the change of base formula. Note that this is the same method that Yuval gives in his answer.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nA different approach is to calculate the number of points $n_d(h)$ in a saturated (maximal) $d$-ary heap of height $h$. Given $n_d(h)$, the height of a $d$-ary heap of size $n$ is the minimal $h$ such that $n_d(h) \\geq n$. Given the formula for $n_d(h)$, you should be able to find $h$ explicitly.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

How much heat has been added to the river by the change in gravitational potential energy in the rivet-Earth system? Also, the river absorbs the heat of the rivet with virtually no temperature change (it's large enough to serve as a \"heat reservoir\"), so what is the change in the entropy of the river from that?\n\n    So there is the entropy change of the cooling rivet plus the entropy change from the change in mechanical energy plus the entropy change from the heat transfer from rivet to river.\n  4. Aug 14, 2011 #3\n    Thanks for the reply.\n\n    So, as I see it, so far I've worked out the decrease in the entropy of the rivet.\n\n    The heat flowing into the reservoir from the rivet cooling will be the same as the heat loss from the rivet:\n\n\n    That gives me 17250 J.\n\n    Then, if we assume the temperature of the reservoir doesn't change, then, using the temperature of the river in Kelvins for T:\n\n\n    That gives me an increase of entropy in the river as 62.1 JK-1\n\n    Finally, the change in gravitational potential energy is:\n\n\n    If we assume that this is all converted to heat in the river we can work out a second component for the increase in entropy. I get S = 0.13 JK-1.\n\n    Overall this gives me a net increase in the entropy of the universe as S = 21.93 JK-1.\n\n    Is this the right track or have I completely messed up?\n  5. Aug 14, 2011 #4\n\n\n    User Avatar\n    Homework Helper\n\n    I agree with those results to the first decimal place (since I rounded off only at the end), so we get a net increase in entropy for the \"universe\" of 21.9 J/K .\n\n    It is a reasonable safe assumption that just about all of the potential energy change is transferred into heating the river. The \"splash\" at impact displaces water and ejects some of it upward (briefly), as well as producing (a minute amount of) acoustical energy. But since practically all the water falls back into the river, that mechanical energy winds up heating the river after all. (We can extend \"the universe\" to include the air over the river, but the tiny amounts of water scattered as microdroplets and vapor and of sound energy probably contribute additions to entropy scarcely worth pursuing...)\n\nSimilar Discussions: Entropy change of a hot, falling object\n  1.

Geometrically, when you solve a 2x2 linear system, you are finding the intersection between a pair of lines. If you reach a contradiction, like the system above, then your lines do not intersect, i.e. they must be parallel.\n\nIf you are being asked this question, you have probably already covered Gauss-Jordan ellimination. Inconsistencies in linear systems can be readily identified if the system is brought to reduced row echelon form (can you see why?), so I would start with that. The steps are simple:\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 1 & h & -5 \\\\ 2 & -8 & 6 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right]$$ Multiply the second row by $1/2$: $$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 1 & h & -5 \\\\ 1 & -4 & 3 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right]$$ Subtract the second row from the first: $$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 0 & h+4 & -8 \\\\ 1 & -4 & 3 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right]$$ Without even proceeding further, it is obvious that one way for the system to be inconsistent is if the first line is $0\\, 0\\, |\\, -8$, since this would be equivalent to saying $0x+0y=-8$, that is $0=-8$, a contradiction. The first row would have this form only if $h=-4$, so $h=-4$ makes the system inconsistent.\n\nNow it is pretty clear at this point that no other value of $h$ would make the system inconsistent, and after you are comfortable with Gauss-Jordan elimination this fact would be apparent to you as well, though you should really try to understand why first. So let's say $h\\ne-4$. Then we can multiply the first row by $\\frac 1 {h+4}$: $$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 0 & 1 & -\\frac 8 {h+4} \\\\ 1 & -4 & 3 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right]$$ And now subtract 4 times the first row from the second: $$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 0 & 1 & -\\frac 8 {h+4} \\\\ 1 & 0 & 3+\\frac {32} {h+4} \\\\ \\end{array}\\right]$$ To really be precise, you can swap the two rows: $$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 1 & 0 & 3+\\frac {32} {h+4} \\\\ 0 & 1 & -\\frac 8 {h+4} \\\\ \\end{array}\\right]$$\n\nThus for any value of $h$ other than $-4$, we can solve the system - there is no way to make the system displayed above have a row which looks like $0\\,0\\,|\\,c$, for any non-zero number $c$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nA simpler solution is based on a theorem that any system $Ax = b$ is consistent iff rank of $[A \\mid b]$ equal to rank of $A$.\n\nTo compute rank of $A$ perform elimination on $A$ to get: $ \\pmatrix{1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -8-2h} $ Hence $\\text{rank}(A)=1$ if $h = -4$ and $\\text{rank}(A) = 2$ otherwise.\n\nTo compute rank of $[A \\mid b]$ perform elimination on $[A \\mid b]$ to get: $$ \\pmatrix{1 & 0 & \\frac{3h-20}{h+4} \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\frac{-8}{h+4}} $$ So for values other that $h=-4$ we have $\\text{rank}([A \\mid b]) = 2$.\n\nComparing two ranks, we have a consistent system other than $h=-4$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nSo it is consistent whenever there is at least one solution. That means that the two lines you have cannot be parallel to each other. Multiply the first row by $2$, and you get $[2, 2h, -10]$. The lines will be parallel for the equations $m_1x+n_1y=a$ and $m_2x+n_2y=b$ if $m_1=m_2$ and $n_1=n_2$. In this case, $m_1=2, m_2=2, n_1=2h, n_2=-8$. Since $m_1 = m_2, n_1 \\neq n_2$, so $2h \\neq -8, h\\neq-4$.\n\nNote that there are an infinite number of solutions (aka consistent) if $m_1=m_2, n_1=n_2,$ and $a=b$. Otherwise, you do not have to worry about the $a$ and $b$ values.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nWow, I was going in the complete wrong direction.

You can think of an augmented matrix as a system of equations, where the each column represents a different dimension, and the last column represents a constant.

Usually, people would use $X_1, X_2, X_3...X_n$ \u2013\u00a0 mathguy Aug 26 '12 at 22:30\n@BMEdwards37 Wait, I want to let you know that you are not going in the wrong direction. You ended up with [0 h+4 -8], which is good! The only way to make sure a system is consistent is that ALL of the values cannot equal 0 (nevermind the last column). In your example, since the first column is 0, then the second column CANNOT be 0, so $h+4\\neq0$. If all of the columns except the last equal 0, then there are no solutions. If all columns including the last equal 0, then there are infinite solutions =) \u2013\u00a0 mathguy Aug 26 '12 at 22:35\nI understood your meaning, didn't catch the negatives either.

(If $N < \\#(S)$ the claim can fail, because all the points in $S$ might lie on one line $l$, and then a degree-$N$ polynomial vanishing on $N$ would vanish identically on $l$.) \u2013\u00a0 Noam D. Elkies Apr 6 '12 at 0:08\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nTo give an explicit answer, choose a system of coordinates $x,y$ such that no two points have the same $x$ coordinate. This is possible since the slopes of lines that pass through pairs of points in the set are only finitely many of all the slopes. Then use basic algebra or the Chinese remainder theorem to find a polynomial equation $y=f(x)$ that passes through all your points. $y-f(x)$ is irreducible so you're done.\n\n(Proof: its degree in $\\mathbb R[x][y]$ is one so it must be the product of a linear and a constant term, but no nontrivial constant terms divide it.)\n\nEdit: A secondary question might be: what is the worst-case scenario lowest-degree polynomial that accomplishes this goal? This method shows that, with $n$ points, there is always a degree $n-1$ irreducible polynomial. Sometimes, there is no degree $n-2$ polynomial: Take $n-1$ points on a line, and one off it. Then an irreducible polynomial vanishing at all $n$ points cannot vanish identically on the line, but vanishes at $n-1$ points on it, so has degree at least $n-1$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nAh and I forgot something, not only must cancel on this points, and be irreducible, also has only that roots , and no more! \u2013\u00a0 Daniel Apr 6 '12 at 5:46\nI would never have thought there was such a beautifully elementary solution: congratulations, Will ! \u2013\u00a0 Georges Elencwajg Apr 6 '12 at 7:15\n@Will Sawin Your polynomials has other roots right?

{"problem": "What is the price elasticity of demand for someone who wants to spend exactly $10 on gasoline, regardless of the starting price?", "final_answer": "-1", "raw_text": "Retrieved from https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/34206/unit-elasticity-calculation-question\nText:\nI'm struggling with a math concept dealing with unit elasticity at an undergraduate textbook level. In most problems, we are given a starting price and an ending price as well as corresponding quantities demanded. For example:\n\nWhen bread was ${$2.00}$ a loaf Bobby wanted ${4}$ loaves, when bread prices raised to ${$2.50}$ Bobby wanted just ${2}$ loaves. What is bobby's price elasticity of demand?\n\nTo calculate these we say the percent change in price is ${\\% \\Delta P = \\frac{$2.50-$2.00}{$2.00}=25\\%}$. The percent change is measured relative to the starting price. Meanwhile ${\\% \\Delta Q = \\frac{2-4}{4}=-50\\%}$. Making elasticity ${-2.0}$.\n\nHowever, I came across a problem where essentially it asked what is the elasticity for someone who wants to spend exactly ${$10}$ on gasoline. I first tried to think about this intuitively, \"If price doubles, she'll be able to get half as much quantity no matter the starting price,\" which seems like elasticity of ${1}$. However, I set it up algebraically I get the following: $${Q*P=10 \\implies Q = 10/P}$$\n\nSo I put in some random values of ${P}$, for example ${P_1=$2.00}$ and ${P_2=$2.50}$ for ${\\% \\Delta P = \\frac{$2.50-$2.00}{$2.00}=25\\%}$. Meanwhile, For quantity we have ${Q_1 = \\frac{10}{2}=5}$ and ${Q_2 = \\frac{10}{2.5}=4}$. So that ${\\% \\Delta Q = \\frac{4-5}{5}=-20\\%}$.... Which isn't unit elastic.\n\nSo I turned to calculus and did the following:\n\n$${Q(P)=\\frac{10}{P} \\implies \\frac{dQ}{Q}*\\frac{P}{dP}=\\frac{dQ}{dP}*\\frac{P}{\\frac{10}{P}}=-\\frac{10}{P^2}*\\frac{P^2}{10}=-1.}$$\n\nWhich is unit elasticity. Clearly the discrepancy here is caused by the fact that the derivative has the \"starting quantity\" = \"ending quantity\" since it's the same point. But should we be measuring percent change relative to starting price and quantity? Or relative to starting price, but ending quantity? Or does it depend? And why?\n\n\nYou have to use the midpoint method to resolve this (if I recall correctly).\n\n\nThe reason I may not recall correctly is because the second you introduce calculus into the study of economics, you discard these formulae entirely and (try to) forget they ever existed. You seem to already know calculus, which is probably causing you to be even more confused rather than less, and understandably so.\n\nThe primary purpose of these non-calculus formulations of elasticity is to teach you the intuition around what elasticity is as a concept - I definitely have strong opinions about how well it accomplishes that. :)\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add that, if indeed the problem is as you're saying it (come hell or high water, Billy is going to spend \\$10 and only \\$10 on gas) then your intuition is right - Billy has unit price elasticity of demand for gas, although in a kludgy sort of way. This is supported by your calculus-based analysis.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Thank you! The material doesn't mention the midpoint method, at all. I think the complication I was having was the disconnect between my intuition about what unit elasticity means and trying to plug in numbers to prove what I was thinking. In some ways it makes sense that it shouldn't be based on the \"starting\" or \"ending\" value since those are relative to our perception of time while it seems elasticity should not depend on such a notion. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0James Bender Feb 27 '20 at 21:48\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Yeah, the formulas you first encounter are various approximations of the \"correct\" calculus method. In addition to the linear method and midpoint method, there's also an arc-length method, all of which are clearly flawed to the observant student in a way that can't be addressed in class because at the first and second year level, calculus is verboten. Heck, you'll be lucky if you see an integral in undergraduate at all, unless you're studying at a top-tier school. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0heh Feb 27 '20 at 22:57\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ By the way the reason the calculus method is \"correct\" is because it produces expressions that you'll see pop out of solutions to more advanced optimization problems. This allows you to talk about things like the optimal Ramsey price in terms of the price elasticities of the products in question, which helps make intuitive sense of some highly abstract concepts. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0heh Feb 27 '20 at 22:59\n\nYour Answer"}

My partial excuses are that first, the function below packages things a bit differently and closer to the syntax of MapAt itself, second, it is a bit more general and has an option to use with Listable function, and third, I am reproducing my solution from the past Mathgroup thread for exactly this question, which is more than 2 years old, so I am not plagiarizing :)\n\nSo, here is the function:\n\nOptions[mapAt] = {MappedListable -> False}; \nmapAt[f_, expr_, {pseq : (All | _Integer) ..}, OptionsPattern[]] := \n  Module[{copy = expr}, \n    copy[[pseq]] = \n      If[TrueQ[OptionValue[MappedListable]] && Head[expr] === List, \n        f /@ copy[[pseq]] \nmapAt[f_, expr_, poslist_List] := MapAt[f, expr, poslist]; \n\nThis is the same idea as what @Mr. Wizard used, with these differences: 1. In case when the spec is not of the prescribed form, regular MapAt will be used automatically 2. Not all functions are Listable. The solution of @Mr.Wizard assumes that either a function is Listable or we want to apply it to the entire list. In the above code, you can specify this by the MappedListable option.\n\nI will also borrow a few examples from my answer in the above-mentioned thread:\n\nIn[18]:= mat=ConstantArray[1,{5,3}];\n\nIn[19]:= mapAt[#/10&,mat,{All,3}]\nOut[19]= {{1,1,1/10},{1,1,1/10},{1,1,1/10},{1,1,1/10},{1,1,1/10}}\n\nIn[20]:= mapAt[#/10&,mat,{3,All}]\nOut[20]= {{1,1,1},{1,1,1},{1/10,1/10,1/10},{1,1,1},{1,1,1}}\n\nTesting on large lists shows that using Listability improves the performance, although not so dramatically here:\n\nIn[28]:= largemat=ConstantArray[1,{150000,15}];\n\nIn[29]:= mapAt[#/10&,largemat,{All,3}];//Timing\nOut[29]= {0.203,Null}\n\nIn[30]:= mapAt[#/10&,largemat,{All,3},MappedListable->True];//Timing\nOut[30]= {0.094,Null}\n\nThis is likely because for the above function (#/10&), Map (which is used internally in mapAt for the MappedListable->False (default) setting, was able to auto-compile. In the example below, the difference is more substantial:\n\nf[x_] := 2 x - 1;\n\nIn[54]:= mapAt[f,largemat,{All,3}];//Timing\nOut[54]= {0.219,Null}\n\nIn[55]:= mapAt[f,largemat,{All,3},MappedListable->True];//Timing\nOut[55]= {0.031,Null}\n\nThe point is that, while f was not declared Listable, we know that its body is built out of Listable functions, and thus it can be applied to the entire list - but OTOH it can not be auto-compiled by Map. Note that adding Listable attribute to f would have been completely wrong here and would destroy the purpose, leading to mapAt being slow in both cases.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nHow can I not vote for this? You always bring a deeper analysis to the table. By the way, \"The solution of @Mr.Wizard assumes that either a function is Listable or we want to apply it to the entire list.\" I thought that was the point of this question based on the example. Yours in certainly an interesting take on it. Your last paragraph highlights something I have wondered about before: is there, or does it make sense to have, some way to assert that a function as \"inherently listable\"? This could help with misuse case 4 here.. \u2013\u00a0 Mr.Wizard Dec 21 '11 at 0:35\n@Mr.Wizard I think one can implement something like the type-inference for Listability, to address this problem. This does not even sound as a very hard problem. \u2013\u00a0 Leonid Shifrin Dec 21 '11 at 18:55\nWhat do you have in mind? It is a very loosely formed idea for me at this time. \u2013\u00a0 Mr.Wizard Dec 21 '11 at 19:07\n@Mr.Wizard The question can be formulated as follows: given a piece of code representing a function call, determine whether or not the result will be internally parallelized by appropriate Listable kernel functions which are called during the evaluation of this piece of code. But I start to see that this is not such a simple problem as I initially thought, so I withdraw my previous statement. \u2013\u00a0 Leonid Shifrin Dec 21 '11 at 19:13\n\nHow about\n\nTranspose[{#[[All, 1]], Rescale[#[[All, 2]]]} &@data]\n\nwhich returns what you want (ie, it does not alter data)\n\nIf no Transpose is allowed,\n\nThread[Join[{#[[All, 1]], Rescale[#[[All, 2]]]} &@data]]\n\n\nEDIT: As \"shortest\" is now the goal, best from me so far is:\n\ndata\\[LeftDoubleBracket]All, 2\\[RightDoubleBracket] = Rescale[data[[All, 2]]]\n\nat 80 characters, which is identical to Mr.Wizard's...

Let $L_0$ be the laplacian of the graph with vertex set $U$ and edges as restricted from $G$, let $L _1 = \\operatorname{diag}\\left( \\sum _{j=1}^n \\mu(u _i, v _j)\\right)$ and $L=L _0+L _1$, also let $A$ be the symmetric matrix whose $a _{ij}$ is $-\\mu(u _i,v _j)$. Clearly the Laplacian of $G$ is $M=\\left( \\begin {array} {cc} L & A \\\\\\ A & L \\end {array} \\right)$. Let $M^*$ stand for the matrix $M$ with deleted first row and column. We have $$\\kappa(G)=\\det \\left( \\begin {array} {cc} L & A \\\\\\ A & L \\end {array} \\right) ^ *=\\det \\left( \\begin {array} {cc} B & C \\\\\\ D & (L+A)^ * \\end {array} \\right)$$ for some block matrices $B,C,D$ of size $n\\times n,n\\times (n-1),$ and $(n-1)\\times n$ where this second matrix was obtained by adding the $i$th row of $M^{\\*}$ to it's $n+i$th row for $1\\le i\\le n-1$ and then adding the first (or last) $n-1$ columns to the $n$th column. So $D$ is the matrix $(L+A)*$ together with a last column of zeros, making $(L+A)^{\\*-1}D$ with integer entries. Next we factor it using one of these identities $$\\kappa(G)=\\det(L+A)^ * \\det(B-C(L+A)^{*-1}D)$$ and observe that $L+A$ is the Laplacian of $G/f$ so $\\det(L+A)^ *=\\kappa(G/f)$, and since the second factor is an integer we get the desired divisibility.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nIt seems to me that the statement \"Clearly the Laplacian of G is M = [[L,A],[A,L]]\" is false.

Your first equation is valid only if complex impedences are used. I fixed the link in my earlier post. Check it out.\n  6. Jul 21, 2005 #5\n    Hello olderdan and geosonel, thank you for your help. I realise I have treated the problem wrongly. However, when I follow your method, i get the total current to be 4.9095 ohm; and the answer given is 0.8865A. Yet, the other two answers are 0.8642A and 0.1964A respectively, which do not add up to 0.8865A...What do you think? :)\n  7. Jul 21, 2005 #6\n    OlderDan -- your comments are, of course, correct.\n    the entire Msg #3 was originally intended to incorporate COMPLEX impedances and use complex representations. clarifications/corrections have been added based on your suggestions.\n\n    Clari --\n    changes were made to Msg #3 to better indicate the COMPLEX representations of the various quatities. do you know how to use these complex representations? specifically, the total current would be equal to:\n    total current = (complex current thru coil) + (complex current thru resistor)\n    = (-0.9095j) + (4)\n\n    total current MAGNITUDE = | (-0.9095j) + (4) |\n\n    [tex] \\ = \\ \\sqrt{(0.9095)^{2} + (4)^{2}} \\ = \\ 4.102 \\ amps [/tex]\n\n    the individual current magnitudes must be combined like shown above because the current thru the coil and current thru the resistor are out of phase (which is why they are represented by complex quantities).\n\n    apparently the book is wrong about the answer. either that or you may have made a careless error in copying the problem. you might double check the problem.\n  8.

I see no way of getting the answers you have been given. A 50 ohm resistor by itself connected to a 200 volt supply would give a 4 amp current. A parallel path through the 0.7H inductor would give a current of 0.9095 amp at 50 hz that is 90 degrees out of phase with the resistor current. You cannot simply add these two (which is effectively what you did by not calculating the equivalent impedence correctly) because they are out of phase, but even when added correctly they still add up to about 4.10 amps, which is a lot more than the answers you are given.\n\n    EDIT: Late to the party again :smile: See geosonel's reply for more detail on the calculations\n\n    Please check the problem and make sure you are stating it correctly. The ratio of the currents given for the separate currents is about right. Is there something else in series with the parallel combination?

Remember that x^12 is an even function, and note that 2^x approaches 0 as x approaches -infinity, but also remember that when x=0 that x^12 = 0, so you know that the two plots cross once for x < 0. You might guess they cross once for x>=0, but think about when x is > say 1000 and when x is say 2. Which function is larger in each case? Which is larger at x=0? Which is larger for x = -1000?\n  4.

Since that fraction itself becomes \"infinity over infinity\" we can apply L'Hopital's rule. Repeatedly differentiating, the numerator just stays 2x (times a power of ln(2)) while the denominator has lower and lower powers eventually becoming a constant (after 12 differentiations, we get 12!) and then 0. What does that tell you about the limit? And what does that tell you about whether 2x or x12 is larger for very large x?\n  5. Oct 18, 2008 #4\n    Thanks! This makes sense. So...\n\n\n    Which means that for very large x, 2^x does eventually exceed x^12, which gives us the third intersection point.\n\n    So, one last question -\n\n    Is this a good general strategy for this type of problem (if I were to get a similar one on the actual exam): First sketch the graph and see what obvious/immediate intersection points I can find. Then use the limit idea for [tex]x\\rightarrow\\infty[/tex] and [tex]x\\rightarrow-\\infty[/tex].\n\n    Will this ensure that I find all of my intersection points?\n\n    Thanks so much! :)\n  6.

For example, it there were 3 more intersections between x= 2 and infinity, the same changes in which is smaller and which is larger would be true. You might try looking at the derivative of f- g. If that is always positive, then that can't happen.\n\nHave something to add?"}

Its normals are the lines through its center, that is, the lines $$y=mx+1$$ for arbitrary $m$ (this leaves out the vertical normal, but that's obviously not normal to the other curve). So now you just have to work out the values of $m$ for which the graph of $y=mx+1$ is normal to the graph of $y^2=4x$. Can you do that?\n\nI guess not, so here goes.\n\nFrom $y^2=4x$ we get $2yy'=4$, so $y'=2/y$. If $(a,b)$ is a point on the graph of $y^2=4x$, then\n1. the slope of the normal to the curve at that point is $-b/2$, and\n2. $b^2=4a$.\nSo the equation of the normal is $$y-b=-(b/2)(x-a)$$ which we can write as $$y=-(b/2)x+(1/2)ab+b$$ But we want the normal to be $y=mx+1$, so $$(1/2)ab+b=1$$ Now combining that with $b^2=4a$, we get, after a little algebra, $$b^3+8b-8=0$$ and it's easy to show that equation has exactly one real zero, so there is exactly one common normal.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nso, no real values of m.

You have an ellipse:\n\n\nThe numbers 2a and 2b are the lengths of the major and minor axes. The \nfoci of the ellipse are at (-c,0) and (c,0), where c = sqrt(a^2-b^2). \nThe length of the string is 2a.\n\nI think 2a is what you have called width and 2b is what you have called \nheight.

It is:\n\n   a^2*y0*y + b^2*x*x0 = a^2*b^2\n\nAssuming (x0,y0) is in the first quadrant, the slope of this line is\n-b^2*x0/(a^2*y0). The slope of the line K perpendicular to this line is \nthe negative reciprocal of this, namely, a^2*y0/(b^2*x0). This is the \ntangent of the angle d.\n\nThe equation of K is y-y0 = a^2*y0/(b^2*x0)(x-x0). Its x-intercept, \nwhich you want, is (set y=0):\n\n   X = x0(1-b^2/a^2) = x0(a^2-b^2)/a^2 = x0*c^2/a^2\n\nSince tan(d) = a^2*y0/(b^2*x0) and x0^2/a^2+y0^2/b^2 = 1, we can \neliminate y0:\n\n   1/x0^2 = (b^2/a^4)tan^2(d) + 1/a^2  \n\nWe now know x0 in terms of d.

{"problem": "Are there any Swedish words that have been directly borrowed from Sami languages, excluding proper nouns and names?", "final_answer": "Yes, examples include 'tundra', 'lunnef\u00e5gel', 'sarv', 'vaja', and 'h\u00e4rk'.", "raw_text": "Retrieved from https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/25564/sami-loanwords-in-swedish-language\nText:\nAre there any words in Swedish borrowed directly from Sami languages? Excluding proper nouns. One example would be enough for \"yes\" answer. A link to some research on related subject is required for \"no\" answer.\n\n\nThe set of candidates is small. The word \"tundra\" is from Saami (Proto-Sami *tuonder), though I don't know if it went direct to Swedish, or via Russian. There are some Saami words used in Norwegian (at least northern Norwegian) which therefore might also be used in Swedish, namely \"duotji\" (handicrafts, not sure how it's spelled in Norwegian), and \"joik\", but one might decide that they aren't yet words 'in Scandinavian'. A rather old word is Swedish lunnef\u00e5gel, Norwegian lunde \"puffin\", from Proto-Sami *londe and Finno-Urgic *lunta \"bird\". Another (possibly not in Swedish) is the northern Norwegian semi-dried cod boknefisk, from Saami boahk- \"dry\". I would be remiss if I didn't mention samisk \"Saami\", which is from Saami.\n\nAddendum: I have to somewhat retract the example duodji (N. Saami spelling), related to the verb duddjot \"to do work by hand\". Sammallahti indicates this comes from Germanic to\u0304wja and Old Notse t\u00f8\u0304ja \"to accomplish\". I was unaware of sarv, vaja, h\u00e4rk in Scandinavian, but you'd expect there to be more influence of Saami in the realm of reindeer terminology. In contrast to the words duodji and joik which are Saami words pretty transparently used in Scandinavian, sarv would most likely be from N. Saami sarvva where it means \"moose\", suggesting that it is an older loan. The example h\u00e4rk also seems to have undergone a semantic shift pointing to it being an older word, since the closest N. Saami noun is heargi \"draft reindeer\", with a number of related derivatives. Interestingly, there is one verb heargut \"to be castrated (of reindeer)\" with the missing semantic element. So while h\u00e4rk surely derives from Saami, it's not just a Saami word that happens to be used in Scandinavian (as duodji is).\n\nFinally there is a Norwegian product name, Boazo, a brand of reindeer meat, transparently derived from N. Saami boazu \u2013 I don't know if that can called a loanword (analogous to Sriracha now being an English word).\n\n  \u2022 I think I have seen the spelling \"duodji\" in Norwegian.\n    \u2013\u00a0OmarL\n    Aug 7 '17 at 10:44\n  \u2022 I've found a couple more examples now: sarv - male reindeer, vaja - female reindeer with calf, h\u00e4rk - castrated male reindeer.\n    \u2013\u00a0Ondska\n    Aug 8 '17 at 13:48"}

If you were to evaluate this with a calculator inputted like as is, the calculator would evaluate it as\u00a0\\(\\frac{6^2}{2}*3+4\\). This is because the 2(3) is really multiplication, so division takes precedence since it is\u00a0comes first in the expression. First it does 6^2, then it divides 6^2 by 2 because division is first from left to right, and then it multiplies that quantity by 3. Here is another example with a variable\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nUsing the same logic as above, this equation, in fraction form is strictly\u00a0\\(\\frac{8}{2}y\\)--not\u00a0\\(\\frac{8}{2y}\\). Some would argue, however, that 2y is a term, so it shouldn't be separated.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHow do we eliminate this ambiguity if there is no fraction button to speak of? Use parentheses!\u00a0\n\n\nAsinus's interpretation of \\(\\frac{6^2}{2*3}+4\\)\u00a0will be unambiguous once you add 1 set of parentheses with\u00a0\\(6^2/(2(3))+4\\). Now, the only correct interpretation is\u00a0\\(\\frac{6^2}{2*3}+4\\)\u00a0because the parentheses indicate that we are dividing by the quantity of the product of 2 and 3.\n\n\nThe strict interpretation is\u00a0\\(\\frac{6^2}{2}*3+4\\)\u00a0should be written like\u00a0\\((6^2/2)(3)+4\\). In this case, the quantity of six squared divided by two is all multiplied by three. No more ambiguity.\n\n\nOkay, after all of this ranting, now I will evaluate what I believe to be, under the current rules of the order of operations, the way to evaluate the expression 6^2/2(3)+4 as\u00a0\\(\\frac{6^2}{2}*3+4\\):\n\n\n\\(\\frac{6^2}{2}*3+4\\) Evaluate the numerator.\u00a0\\(6^2=36\\)\n\\(\\frac{36}{2}*3+4\\) Simplify the fraction\u00a0by recognizing that the 36 is divisible by 2 because 36 is even.\n\\(18*3+4\\) Do multiplication before addition.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheXSquaredFactor \u00a0Aug 3, 2017\n\nHello\u00a0 \\(X^2\\)\n\nNeither of us is wrong.\nRight, who puts brackets to represent the meaning of his term.\ngreetings :)\n\nasinus \u00a0Aug 4, 2017\n\nGreetings to you, too :)\n\nTheXSquaredFactor \u00a0Aug 5, 2017\n\n23 Online Users"}

(There is one and only one such \ndirection, as can be seen if you move one line parallel to itself \nuntil it intersects the other line. These two lines would now define a \nplane, and the perpendicular to this plane is the direction of the \ncommon perpendicular).  \n\nYou now take any point on one line, and any point on the other line, \nand write down the vector joining these two points.  Finally you find \nthe component of this vector in the direction of the common \nperpendicular.  This is done by finding the scalar product of the \nvector with the UNIT vector in the direction of the common \nperpendicular.  The result of the scalar product is the shortest \ndistance you require.  \n\nI will illustrate the method by means of an example. \n\nFind the shortest distance between the lines:\n\nx/1 = (y-3)/1 = z/(-1)\n\n(x-5)/3 = (y-8)/7 = (z-2)/(-1)\n\nFirst we require the vector perpendicular to both (1,1,-1) and \n\nLet the common perpendicular be (p,q,r). The scalar product of this \nwith both (1,1.-1) and (3,7,-1) will be zero, so:\n\n   p+q-r = 0 and 3p+7q-r = 0\n\nNote that although there are apparently 3 unknowns and only two \nequations, these are homogeneous equations (having 0 on the right hand \nside), so we could find values of p/r and q/r and hence the ratios \np:q:r which is all that we require.  Using the determinant method for \nsolving, we have:\n\n    p       -q          r\n|1  -1|   |1  -1|     |1   1|\n|7  -1|   |3  -1|     |3   7|\n\n   p/6  =  -q/2    =   r/4\n\n   p/3  =  q/-1    =   r/2   and so  p:q:r = 3:-1:2\n\nSo the common perpendicular is the vector (3,-1,2)\n\nAs a UNIT vector this is (1/sqrt(14)){3,-1,2}\n\nNext we have point (0,3,0) on line (1) and (5,8,2) on line (2).  \nThe vector joining these points is (5,5,2)  and now scalar product \nthis with the unit vector of the common perpendicular.\n\nScalar product = (1/(sqrt(14)){5*3 + 5*(-1) + 2*2}\n               = (1/sqrt(14)){15 - 5 + 4}\n               = 14/sqrt(14)\n               = sqrt(14)    \n\n   and this is the shortest distance required.\n\n-Doctor Anthony,  The Math Forum\n Check out our web site!   \nAssociated Topics:\nHigh School Geometry\nHigh School Higher-Dimensional Geometry\nHigh School Linear Algebra\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM"}

So:\n\n     g(1) = 1\n     g(2) = 3\n     g(3) = 6\n\nand so on. You probably know that:\n\n     g(n) = n(n+1)/2\n\nLet f(n) be the sum of the triangular numbers 1 through n.\n\n     f(n) = g(1) + g(2) + ... + g(n)\n\n     f(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)/6\n\nHow can we prove this? We can prove it by induction. That is, we'll \nprove two things:\n   1) It's true for some n (n=1, in this case).\n   2) If it's true for n, then it's true for n+1.\n\nThis will allow us to conclude that it's true for all n >= 1.\n\nNow 1) is easy. We know that f(1) = g(1) = 1. So it's true for n = 1.\n\nNow for 2). Suppose it's true for n. Consider f(n+1). We have:\n\n     f(n+1) = g(1) + g(2) + ... + g(n) + g(n+1) \n            = f(n) + g(n+1)\n\nUsing our assumption that f(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)/6 and that \ng(n+1) = (n+1)(n+2)/2, we have:\n\n     f(n+1) = n(n+1)(n+2)/6 + (n+1)(n+2)/2\n            = n(n+1)(n+2)/6 + 3(n+1)(n+2)/6\n            = (n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/6\n\nwhich is exactly what the formula says it should be. Thus we have \nshown that if it's true for n, it's true for n + 1. Since we showed it \nwas true for n = 1, we now know it's also true for n = 1 + 1 = 2, and \nthen for n = 2 + 1 = 3, and so on, for all n >= 1.\n\nBy the way, these numbers (1,4,10,20,35,56,...) are known as \ntetrahedral numbers. If you imagine piling triangles of dots on top of \none another first 1, then 3, then 6, then 10 you'll get a tetrahedron \nof dots at each stage with 1,4,10,20 dots total.

These p-1 residue classes are exactly \nthe residue classes representing numbers with a GCD of 1 with p.\n\nNow if we multiply all these representatives of these p-1 residue \nclasses by n, we get n*1, n*2, ... , n*(p-1). No two of these numbers \ncan be in the same residue class modulo p, because if n*x == n*y (mod \np) then x == y (mod p) (see above).

You're teetering close to the edge of checking whether the student has guessed your solution to the problem rather than whether the student has solved the problem.\n\nThis is easy to do, especially in cases like this where a problem is constructed with the specific purpose of exercising a particular technique (eg, your solution).\n\nThis purposeful construction inflicts the problem setter with a bit of blindness for other potential solution paths - when we solve a problem, we stop looking for different angles on it. And being presented with an alternate solution path can also be a little blow to the ego - because of the implicit suggestion that the problem doesn't serve its purpose perfectly, eg, the desired technique was not required.\n\nMy suggestion would be to congratulate the student on their straightforward approach, and explain that you had tripped yourself up with the expectation of a different line of thought.\n\nMoving forward, there's nothing wrong with prescribing a technique for problems when you want a particular technique to be used. (Excepting that one can get into a bit of a taxonomical nightmare when trying to put names on individual techniques for things. May be better to treat the technique names as disposable: eg, Tuesday's Method can be a labelled technique from the class notes).\n\n| improve this answer | |\n\nI do not see any issue $\\iff$ it is clear what the sequence of equations means. (Sorry for the pun.)\n\nThe following is true (for $a \\neq 0$, in the real numbers, say)\n\n$$ax+b = c \\iff ax =c-b \\iff x = \\frac{c-b}{a}$$ Hence the solution $x$ must be $x=\\frac{c-b}{a}.$\n\nEach transformation is an equivalence. The problem is that sometimes some do not pay enough attention and write sequences of equations like this that in fact are not equivalences. (Or perhaps they pay attention but just mean to express something different.)\n\nFor example the following might be written but does not give uniqueness: \\begin{align*} x^2 +5 & = 9 \\\\ x^2 & = 4 \\\\ x & = 2 \\end{align*} The issue is that the last equation is not an equivalence; it is false that $x^2 = 4 \\iff x = 2$ (again in the reals, that is; in the positive reals it would be true).\n\nThe main issue I see, but this is the same for the students and your solution, is that it is not completely made clear (at least in what is written) what the sequence of equation means.\n\nFor example, would we work over the $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ your solution would not show uniqueness either as even for $a\\neq 0$ the equation $ax=ay$ is not equivalent to $x= y$.\n\nAdded: The discussion above uses equivalence ($\\iff$) that is \"if and only if\" throughout.

What your student did was if $x$ is a solution to $ax +b = c$ ($a \\neq 0$), then $x= \\frac{c-b}{a}$ implying that if $y$ is another solution, then $y = \\frac{c-b}{a} = x$.\n\nBoth ways should be explained as valid forms of proving uniqueness. While supposing if $x$ and $y$ are solutions, then $ax +b = c = ay+b$, the leap to setting both equations equal might be a leap for some. For instance, I personally would show that all solutions have the same form to get uniqueness. You could add that, since this is a proof class, that linear functions are one-to-one or injective to get the desired result as well. This allows for quite a bit of generalization for linear systems of equations.\n\nIn the end, if the student uses a valid proof for something that is not what you were considering, congratulate them and, perhaps, point out the method you were intending.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n\nActually, I get a bit confused about this, each step he took was reversable.

I need help on an optimization problem. The problem is as follows:\n\nfind x=(est_pos_1, ... est_pos_n)\nminimizing the sum of squared difference between elements in matrix A and B\na_ij = 1 if Euclidean distance between est_pos_i and est_pos_j is less than constant R and 0 otherwise, 0 < i, j < m + n, m is number of points with known position, n of points with unknown positions to be estimated, b_ij = 1 if Euclidean distance between actual_pos_i and actual_pos_j is less than R and 0 otherwise. Matrix B is given.\n\nI tried solving it using Particle Swarm Optimization with poor success, i.e. the error between the estimated and actual positions is high.\n\n\nWalter Roberson on 22 Mar 2013\n\nThe two matrices A and B appear to be different sizes, as B only goes as far as the known positions but A extends to estimated positions. I am not sure what the sum of the squared difference would mean for different sized matrices?\n\nIf the values are all 0's and 1's, then squared difference would be the same as absolute difference, right? And in turn would be the same as \"not equal\" ?\n\nWhat does it mean to estimate position (i,j) for points whose actual position is known?\n\nGFX on 29 Mar 2013\n\nHi, the size of A an B are of the same size. However, instead of determine all m+n points, we are to decide only on the position of n unknown points, since the m points we already known their position from prior knowledge. We are to determine positions of est_pos_i (estimated positions of unknown points i, n of these) given some connectivity constrains, given by B. So, we are trying to recreate the position of all points based on connectivity readings. In actual, B can be obtained for e.g. say the points know who their neighboring points are. However, for simulation, B can simply be calculated by determining if the distances between the actual positions between any pair of points. In simulation, we also have the exact positions of all points. I hope I am clear. Thank you.\n\nGFX on 29 Mar 2013\n\nAnd the objective here is to recreate the configuration (positioning) of points that resembles the exact configuration. Hence the sum of square difference objective.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nNo products are associated with this question.\n\n1 Answer\n\nAnswer by Matt J on 29 Mar 2013\nEdited by Matt J on 29 Mar 2013\nAccepted answer\n\nNo, you can't use the Optimization Toolbox. The solvers in the Toolbox are smooth algorithms (except for bintprog) and therefore apply to differentiable functions.\n\nHowever, your matrix A, and therefore the objective function overall, is a piecewise constant, non-differentiable, function of x. The piecewise constant behavior will also mean that the objective function is flat almost everywhere, making almost every point a local minimum where the optimization can get stuck.\n\n\nGFX on 29 Mar 2013\n\nFor example, how do I easily and quickly determine if such a problem is say linear, convex, or non linear? I know about the standard forms of LP, convex programs and such, but for eg. in my original question, how do you determine them?\n\nMatt J on 29 Mar 2013\n\nWell, I don't think there's always an easy way. Certainly optimization textbooks will always give examples of functions that are convex etc... and you build your analysis skills from that.\n\nHowever, in your case, the A matrix can only take on values 0 or 1. Discrete-valued functions like that have to be piecewise constant.\n\nGFX on 31 Mar 2013\n\nThanks Matt J, thanks all. :-)\n\nMatt J\n\nContact us"}

You can play as many rounds as you want, and the last number you draw is the number of dollars you win, but each round costs an extra $1.

You get a number out of the hat, and either stop or go on. And you do it in some \"optimal\" way (maximizes expectation). If you do go on, the rule that will ensure you the maximal expectation is the same rule you used before - your original optimal rule.\n\nThis shows that your stopping rule can be characterized by some threshold $X$, which is the minimal number for which you'd stop (alternatively we could have chosen $X-1$, which is the maximal number for which you'd go on). Denote the expected gain by $E$. We have $$ E = -1 + \\frac{X-1}{100}E + \\frac{\\sum_{t=X}^{100} t}{100} = -1 + \\frac{X-1}{100} + \\frac{(100-X+1)(100+X)}{200}. $$ Multiplying by $200$ and rearranging, we get $$ 2(101-X)E = (101-X)(100+X) - 200. $$ Therefore $$ E = \\frac{(101-X)(100+X) - 200}{2(101-X)}. $$ This is maximized by $101 - 10\\sqrt{2} \\approx 86.86$. Thus the best value for $X$ is either $86$ or $87$. These values give $E \\approx 86.33$ and $E \\approx 86.37$, so $X = 87$ is better, and the value of the game is $1209/14$.\n\nMy calculations don't agree with Ross's, so there's probably a mistake somewhere; this doesn't invalidate the method.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nOur philosophies are the same. I think the difference is the factor $\\frac{100\u2212\u230aR\u230b}{100}$ in my first term, which is the chance that the next draw will be accepted. I think that should multiply your third term, which is the $\\frac{100+\u230aR\u230b}{2}$ part. I just edited my subtraction of the cost of another play, which decreased the expected value by 1. It appears it \"wants\" the expected value to be just below a natural. \u2013\u00a0 Ross Millikan Mar 17 '11 at 6:12\nadd comment\n\nYour expected return if you draw a number on the last round is 49.5 (because it costs a dollar to make the draw). On round N-1, you should keep what you have if it is greater than 49.5, or take your chances if it is less. The expected value if N=2 is then $\\frac {51}{100}\\frac {100+50}{2} -1 + \\frac {49}{100}49.5=61.505$ where the first term is the chance that you keep the first draw times the expectation of that draw (assuming you will keep it), the second is the cost of the first draw, and the third is the chance that you will decline the first draw and take your chances on the second times the expectation of the second draw.\n\nAdded: As Yuval makes more explicit, your strategy will be to quit when you get a number at least $X$. The gain then is $\\frac{100+X}{2}-\\frac{100}{101-X}$ where the first is the payoff and the second is the cost of the expected number of plays. As he says, this is maximized at X=87 with value $\\frac{1209}{14}=86.3571$. I'll have to think where I was a bit off.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nEdit: I've added some information about the game with a restricted number $N$ of rounds, since the OP mentioned this.\n\nJust a comment to complement the nice answers we have already.\n\nThere is an algorithm that calculates the optimal strategy and the value of each state for such an optimal stopping problem.\n\nLet $f(x)$ be the payout at each state $x\\in {\\cal S}$ for the underlying Markov chain $(X_n)$, and let $g(x)$ be the cost of leaving state $x$.\n\nSet $u_0=f$ and for $N\\geq 1$ put $u_N=\\max(Pu_{N-1}-g,f)$.

The optimal strategy is to stop when the chain hits the set $\\lbrace x: f(x)=v(x)\\rbrace$. Here $v(x)$ means the value of state $x$, i.e., $v(x)$ is the maximum expected payout starting in state $x$ and using any finite stopping time $T$ as a strategy:\n\n$$v(x)=\\sup_T\\ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ f(X_T)\\, | \\, X_0=x\\right].$$\n\nThis is all nicely explained in the section on Optimal Stopping in Gregory Lawler's book \"Introduction to Stochastic Processes\".\n\nIn your problem we have $f(x)=x$ for $1\\leq x\\leq 100$, and $g(x)\\equiv 1$. Your Markov chain $(X_n)$ is a sequence of independent, uniform $\\lbrace 1,2,\\dots, 100\\rbrace $ random variables. Thus the $P$ operator applied to $h$ gives the constant function whose value is the average value of $h$, that is, $Ph(x)\\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{100} h(i)/100$. So we calculate $$u_0(x)=x,\\quad u_1(x)=\\max\\left(x,{99\\over 2}\\right), \\quad u_2(x)=\\max\\left(x,{12301\\over 200}\\right). $$\n\nTaking very large $N$ gives $$v(x)\\approx \\max\\left(x,{86.35714}\\right),$$ which shows that the optimal strategy (over all finite stopping times!) is to quit as soon as we get $87$ or higher, and the value of the game is $86.35714$ dollars.\n\nIn your problem it is pretty straightforward to calculate the exact answer, but this algorithm also gives the answer for more complicated games where exact calculations are not so easy.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

The correspondence is via a magic square (subtracting 5 from each number in a standard $3\\times 3$ square containing 1 through 9), and you can check manually that there are no extra relations of three numbers summing to 0. \u2013\u00a0 Owen Biesel Aug 2 '12 at 14:56\nI would have thought that the \"general case\" would define the winner as the first player to collect $n\u22121$ cards that sum to zero. Also, I'm wondering if your original phrasing was: each with a distinct number from $1$ to $2n + 1$, where the first player to collect three cards that sum to $2n + 1$ wins the game. Then tic-tac-toe is the special case $n = 7$, where we construct a $3x3$ magic square and let that determine the optimal strategy. \u2013\u00a0 Benjamin Dickman Aug 2 '12 at 15:38\n@Patricia: The correspondence starts with a magic square, where the rows, columns and diagonals all sum to 15, not with the numbers 1-9 in a standard array (that's a Muggle square). \u2013\u00a0 Zack Wolske Aug 2 '12 at 20:53\nshow 3 more comments\n\n3 Answers\n\nup vote 9 down vote accepted\n\nFirst player wins for $n$ at least five. First turn, name $0$. They name a number, say $-a$. Choose two numbers $b$ and $c$ such that neither $b$, $c$, nor $b+c=a$. Then name $b$, forcing them to name $-b$, then $c$, forcing them to name $-c$, then $-b-c$, winning. You can always choose two such numbers, since each positive number is missed by one of the following triples: $1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+4=5, 2+3=5$.\n\nAs quid points out, this is more complicated than I originally made it seem. If $c\\neq a+b$ but $a+b$ is in the interval, then the second player can name $a+b$ in response to $c$ and win.\n\nTo avoid this, if $1 <a\\leq n-2$, choose $b=1$ and $c=a+1$. Neither $1$, $a+1$, nor $a+2=a$ so this works.\n\nIf $a\\geq n-1$, choose $b=2$ and $c=1$. Since $n\\geq 5$, neither $1$, $2$, nor $3=a$ so this works, and $a+b=a+2>n$.\n\nIf $a=1$, choose $b=2$ and $c=3$, so $c=a+b$ and neither $2$, $3$, nor $5=a$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nClever!

Say let n=5, so we choose 0 (according to startegy) and they choose say -4. Now (according to strategy) we choose b=1 and c=2 so neither 1, 2, nor 1+2 is 4. Then we name b=1 so they need to name -1. And now we name c=2. Yet now we lost if they choose 5 (instead of -2)!

We choose $3$ defending against their (only) winning move and creating again two potential wins (at $-3$ and $-4$), and thus winning.\n\n  3. They choose $-(n-1)$. Then we choose $1$. They have to choose $-1$. We choose $n$ defending their winning move. They need to choose $-n$, which does not create any winning move for them, so we can choose $2$, creating two winning options ($-2$ and $-3$) [note due to $n \\ge 5$ there is no interference with the earlier moves], and thus win.\n\n  4.

This is an interesting question which would be approached in different ways depending on the context in which it arrives (e.g., level of a course). For example, the curves could be assumed to be smooth or merely rectifiable. They could be assumed to be graphs, or not. The attainment of minimal length could be taken for granted, or require a proof. All this makes it hard to pitch the answer at the right level, and I'm most likely going to fail at that. Indeed, I do not see how one would get a solution in the form of a series, because in general the minimizer is not analytic. If this problem comes from a textbook, it would be helpful to have a reference so that an answer can be given within the context of that book.\n\nIf the existence and differentiability of a minimizing curve can be granted, then there is a variational argument to show it must have the same curvature at all points where it does not meet the constraint (i.e, does not lie on the vertical or horizontal axis). Indeed, write the curve in vector form $\\gamma(t)$, parametrized by arclength, and consider the perturbation $$\\Gamma(t)=\\gamma(t)+\\epsilon \\eta(t) R\\gamma'(t)$$ where $\\epsilon$ is a parameter, $\\eta$ is a smooth function with compact support, and $R$ denotes rotation by $\\pi/2$ clockwise. Note that $(Ru)\\times v =u\\cdot v$ and $u\\times Rv=-u\\cdot v$. The area bounded by $\\Gamma$ is expressed as an integral of $\\Gamma\\times \\Gamma'$, in which the linear term in $\\epsilon $ simplifies to $$2\\epsilon \\eta \\gamma'\\cdot \\gamma' - \\epsilon (\\eta \\gamma\\cdot \\gamma')' $$ Here the first term yields $2\\epsilon \\int \\eta$ and the second integrates to zero. Thus, we should have $\\int \\eta=0$ to preserve the area up to $O(\\epsilon^2)$.\n\nThe length of $\\Gamma$ is given by the integral of $|\\Gamma'(t)| = (\\Gamma'(t)\\cdot \\Gamma'(t))^{1/2}$ in which the linear term simplifies to\n$$ \\epsilon \\eta (\\gamma' \\cdot R\\gamma'') = \\epsilon \\eta \\kappa $$ where $\\kappa$ is the curvature of $\\gamma$. The conclusion is that $\\int \\eta \\kappa =0$ for any $\\eta$ such that $\\int \\eta =0$. Equivalently, $\\kappa$ is constant.\n\nThus, the minimizing curve will be a circular arc as long as it is free to move; i.e., as long as it does not hit the obstacle (vertical or horizontal axes). And the obstacle does get involved when $A$ is so small that no circular arc through $(0,a)$ and $(1,0)$ can bound area $A$ and stay within the first quadrant. When the obstacle takes effect, the minimizing curve consists of parts of the vertical and/or horizontal axes joined by a circular arc that is tangent to them. An obstacle must always be met tangentially: otherwise the point of contact could slide along the obstacle, decreasing length. This takes a separate perturbation argument, into which I will not go.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

Is there a general formula for the volume of an ARBITRARY polyhedron? I know everything there is to know about the polyhedron - the coordinates of the vertices, the equations of the planes that form the walls, the number of walls, the number of sides, the number of vertices, etc. About the only restriction that is put on the polyherdon is that it is \"convex\", i.e. all vertices lie in a single \"half-space\" relative to any wall. I was trying to do it by breaking up the polyhedron into a collection of tetrahedra and summing up the volumes of the tetrahedra, but I can't seem to come up with an algorithm that allows me to determine which vertices form the tetrahedra that make up the polyhedron. Any ideas? Is there a better nad easier way to do this? Please Cc: me if you post a followup, if at all possible. Thanks! Boyan -- Boyan I. Boyanov ============================================================================== From: (Dave Rusin) Newsgroups: sci.math Subject: Re: Volume of a tetrahedron Date: 27 Mar 1995 22:52:56 GMT In article <3l50vi$>, Boyan I. Boyanov wrote: >Is there a general formula for the volume of an ARBITRARY polyhedron? Well, I suppose I ought to answer this since I just advertised Green's theorem for a similar purpose. In this question, the author wants a space integral integral_P 1 dxdydz where P is the polyhedron. The corresponding technique is to use Stokes' Theorem, whose general form _ _ _/ w = _/ dw boundary(S) S (for w any differential form on S) specializes for 2-forms to _ _ _/ P dxdy + Q dydz + R dzdx = _/ (dP/dz + dQ/dx + dR/dy) dxdydz so we can get the space integral of 1, for example, by integrating the 2-form z dxdy over the surface of the polyhedron. We can compute the surface integrals face-by-face. The quick answer here is that the individual surface integrals, when divided by the area of the face, would compute the average value of the z coordinate on the face. Therefore, we can compute the surface integrals easily by averaging the z coordinates of the vertices of the face, and multiplying by an area: the surface integral int( zdxdy ) over a face spanned by (x0 y0 z0), (x1 y1 z1), and (x2 y2 z2) is (z0+z1+z2)/3 . | (1/2)( y1.(x0-x2) + y2.(x1-x0) + y0.(x2-x1) ) | This surface integral is added to the total if the three points are in counterclockwise order as seen from the outside of the polyhedron, subtracted otherwise. A proof is appended as a postscript to this post; it may perhaps reinforce an understanding of surface integrals. It perhaps bears mentioning that this procedure does not assume the polyhedron is convex, nor indeed homeomorphic to a sphere. It does assume that the polyhedron is closed (no boundary) and a triangularization of a manifold (which will then be compact and orientable, conditions which I would otherwise have to add). It is not necessary that all the faces be triangles, really, although any other polygons may be so divided. The method may also be extended to other surface integrals besides volume, and so for example may be used to compute the center of mass. One can remove the absolute values and simply add in the polynomial expression if an orientation is chosen consistent with the \"right-hand-rule\" for outward pointing normals. As in the previous post I will concede that there is some redundant calculation here, so that if it is important that the computation be done quickly it pays to watch for repeated line integrals and so on. dave __Derivation of formula for surface integral over one face__ Assuming that the face is not vertical, we can write z = Ax+By+C for some constants A, B and C (easily computed from any three non-collinear vertices on the face). Then that face contributes to the surface integral the sum A integral(x) + B integral(y) + C integral(1) where the integral may be taken over the projection of the face to the xy-plane (translation: ignore the z coordinates on the face). There is an orientation problem: the integral over the projection to the xy-plane will be off by a sign if the polyhedron faces \"in\" rather than \"out\", so you will need to know whether the interior of the polyhedron contains those points whose z coordinates are just larger than Ax+By+C or just smaller. In a previous post, I discussed integrating these very three surface integrals around a polygon. (These were done with Green's theorem.) The upshot is that these integrals may be computed as simple sums around the perimeter of the polygon. The segment from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1) contributes (x0 + x1)/2 . (y1-y0) to the integral of 1 over the polygon, (x0^2 + x0 x1 + x1^2)/6 . (y1-y0) to the integral of x, and ( (y0 x1 + x0 y1) + 2(x1 y1 + x0 y0) )/6 . (y1 - y0) to the integral of y. So, for example, if one face of your polyhedron is a triangle with vertices (x0,y0,z0), (x1,y1,z1), and (x2,y2,z2), then the equation for the plane is z = Ax + By + C where A, B, and C are determined by ( A ) ( x0 y0 1 )^{-1} ( z0 ) ( B ) = ( x1 y1 1 ) ( z1 ) ( C ) ( x2 y2 1 ) ( z2 ) We compute the line integrals around the triangle in the xy-plane: the integral of 1 is I1 = (1/2)( y1.(x0-x2) + y2.(x1-x0) + y0.(x2-x1) ) as in a followup I made to the previous post; the integral of x is this times (x0+x1+x2)/3, and the integral of y is the same factor I1 times (y0+y1+y2)/3. (All these should have their sign adjusted in case the points (x0,y0), (x1,y1), (x2,y2) do not wrap counterclockwise around the triangle. The correction is easy: since integral(1)=Area > 0, the sign correction to multiply by is just the sign S1 of I1. Thus, the surface integral over this face is the linear combination [ A(x0+x1+x2)/3 + B(y0+y1+y2)/3 + C ] . (S1 I1) As it happens, I1 is precisely the determinant of the matrix to be inverted above, so multiplyng thru we see that A B and C may be replaced by the cofactors, making division unnecessary. Apart from the sign correction, the previous surface integral may thus be written (z0.(y1-y2)+z1.(y2-y0)+z2.(y0-y1)) . (x0+x1+x2)/3 + (z0.(x2-x1)+z1.(x0-x2)+z2.(x1-x0)) . (y0+y1+y2)/3 + (z0.(x1y2-x2y1)+z1.(x2y0-x0y2)+z2.(x0y1-x1y0)) This, in turn, simplifies to just (z0+z1+z2)/3 . (I1) (again, times the sign correction so that S1 I1 > 0 ) This is the formula given above."}

You'll be able to see a few red dwarfs with binoculars, and quite a few more with a telescope. (Plus a bunch more G and K class stars.)

Typical distances are less than a kiloparsec (3000 light-years, see for example post by @RobJeffries). Red-Giants (RG) still have a lifetime of about 10 Million years*, so only something like $10^{-4}$ would have already \"died\"... which means even if every single naked-eye star were a RG, only about 1 of those 10,000 would likely have already died. So the answer is probably 0-1 stars.\n\nSince the list of naked-eye (ish) stars is compiled, it wouldn't be too hard to just go through and see which (if any) have a non-negligible probability of having died... would be a good class project for someone! This, of course, completely neglects binarity... which is hard to model, even in detail. Naively, I think binaries are more likely to extend lifetimes than shorten them, however - so that probably makes this estimate even more optimistic.\n\nIn regards to the change from using Binoculars instead: again this could be explored using the above-linked catalog but I suspect @DavidHammen is right (in the comments above) - that the bulk of stars that become visible with Binoculars are low-mass dwarfs, decreasing the fraction of likely-to-have-died-visible-stars, and negligibly increasing the total expected number of dead stars.\n\n*Regarding RG lifetime, I'm not finding any great sources for lifetimes, but 10 Myr is the number of remember offhand. It looks like that might be on the lower end---again making this estimate more optimistic.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I think 1 Myr is more realistic for red giant evolution. Main sequence lifetimes for the most massive visible stars eg. Gamma Vel, are already less than 10 Myr. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0ProfRob Dec 8 '16 at 0:05\n\nYour Answer"}

In how many ways can they sit so that a man can't sit next to a woman who is not his wife?\n\nI have tried but I am not sure to the following answer :\n\nFirst, the husbands sit in the circular table of which the possible ways is $3!$.\n\nThe wives should sit next to her husband which is only $1$ way.\n\nThe two men can only be put between two husbands in only $2$ ways and they then can be permuted in $2$ ways. So the number of ways is $4$.\n\nBy applying the multiplication principle, the total number of ways for this possibility is $3! \\times 4$ = $24$.\n\nThe second possibility is similar which is making the wives sit first and put each husband next to his own wife and then put the single men. The total number of ways is also $24$.\n\nSo the answer is $24 + 24 = 48$.\n\n\nAs each woman has two neighbors, one way to have a woman not sit next to a man who is not her husband is to line up husband$_1$ wife$_1$ wife$_2$ husband$_2$ twice. Then we have three ways to pair up the couples and two ways to flip each pair left/right. We might as well put the leftmost of the pair including husband A at seat $1$ to break the rotational symmetry. Then there are three groups of seats for the other married couple and a factor two for placing the single men. Total is $$3 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2=72$$\nThe other way to deal with the women is to place all four together in some order, $4!$ ways and seat the husbands of the end ones next to them. Again break the symmetry by seating the leftmost woman in seat $1$. Now you can arrange the other four men any way you want, another $4!$ ways, giving $$4!^2=576$$ The total is then $$72+576=648$$\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Do you think OP wants to consider rotational overcounts? $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0K.

In the first case two men must sit next to their respecive wives in positions 5 and 10, while the other four men sit in any fashion that choose in positions 6-7-8-9. Thus 24\u00d724 = 576 permutations. For the second arrangement of the women, all four husbands must sit next to their wives leaving only the two single men with any free choice. Thus 24\u00d72 = 48 permutations.\n\nThe third female arrangement is tricky, in fact I had to edit my answer because I got it wrong the first time. If we count 24 permjtations for the women and two for the single men we seem to get 48. But because the women (and their husbands) are in a twofold rotationally symmetric arrangemet only half of these 48 are actually distinct. So we can really count only 24 additional permutations to go with the 576+48 from the other cases. Total: 648.\n\n\nYour Answer"}

Unfortunately, they started this semester in a bit of a slump, winning only 40 of their first 90 games in various inter-school competitions. That gave them a winning percentage of only about 44%.\n\nThen they found a new coach, who inspired them and significantly improved their overall level of play. This month they went on a hot streak, winning 3 out of every 5 games they played.\n\nWe used a scenario to loosen our thinking up and try to focus on three big preparation themes: prerequisite knowledge, big math ideas, and multiple approaches.\n\nLooking at the scenario, the Noyce Scholars noticed and wondered about cool math like:\n\n  \u2022 Quantities are represented as percentages, fractions, and ratios in this problem.\n  \u2022 How could you determine which coach was better? How do you know for sure?\n  \u2022 What\u2019s the overall winning percentage, based on the number of games played, before and after the new coach.\n  \u2022 If they won 40 out of 90 games at first, how many games might they play over a year? A week?\n  \u2022 How come winning 3 out of 5 is an improvement over winning 40 out of 90?\n  \u2022 They increased their winning percentage by 16 percent\n\nAll of these noticings and wonderings gave us insight into two of our three foci.\n\n  1. What do students need to know/understand to work on a problem about this story?\n    \u2022 Fractions, ratios, and percents and how they are related\n    \u2022 How winning percentages are calculated\n    \u2022 That two coaches are being compared and one might be better than the other; the team improved over time\n  2.

I revealed that after playing some more games, the team\u2019s overall winning percentage climbed to exactly 52% and we wondered, \u201chow many games did they play? How many did they win?\u201d Recalling that they won 3 out of every 5 games, we set to work.\n\nThe multiple methods that we used were Make a Table, Guess and Check, and Make a Mathematical Model (an algebraic model, in this case).\n\nThen we took a look at the work of an Algebra I student, M.:\n\n\nThey played 85 games that month\n\n\nFor this problem I did guess and check. First I tried 40/90 and 30/50 because it says they won 3/5 games so 70/140 was 50% which was too little so I tried 33+40/55+90 and got 50.3% so I realized I needed to go up a lot more. Then I tried 60/100 + 40/90 and 100/190 and got 52.6% so I went down a bit and did 94/180 and got 52.22222% so I went down more and did 91/175 and 52% evenly. so they had played 90 games and now they played a total of 175, so they played 85 games that month\n\nCheck- 40/90 + 51/90 is 91/175 which is 52%\n\nHere are some of the initial things we noticed and wondered about M\u2019s work:\n\n  \u2022 She checks her work at the bottom\n  \u2022 In the check, she adds 40/90 + 51/90 = 91/175 and we wondered how she was using that calculation to check her work\n  \u2022 We also wondered in the check if she meant 51/85 instead of 51/90 because 51/85 was used earlier in the problem and would represent winning 3 out of every 5 games (17 sets of 5 games)\n  \u2022 We wondered how she thought of her first guess, 30/50\n  \u2022 We noticed that sometimes she used \u201cand\u201d and sometimes she used the \u201c+\u201d sign\n  \u2022 We noticed she used fraction notation and wondered if she was using it informally, using \u201c+\u201d to mean \u201cand\u201d and using \u201c/\u201d to mean \u201cout of\u201d\n  \u2022 We noticed that she got the correct answer, and it didn\u2019t take her very many guesses at all!\n\nAnd finally, we thought of some questions we could ask M. to help her revise her work and keep reflecting on the problem such as:\n\n  \u2022 This time, it took you 5 guesses to get the answer. What are some ways you could find an answer with fewer guesses next time you solve a similar problem?\n  \u2022 How did you decide what guess to start at? What did you notice in the problem that led to your first guess?\n  \u2022 How would you explain your steps and calculations to another student who is stuck and doesn\u2019t understand how to make a guess and check it?\n  \u2022 Each time you did a calculation you wrote it a different way. If you pick one of the ways (e.g. 33+40/55+90) and translate all the other calculations into that format, what patterns do you notice in the calculations?\n\nThe final step, which we ran out of time for, is to get feedback on the questions we generated. Which of them are engaging? Which inspire reflection and meta-cognition? What do you think of the tone of each question?\n\nBy the way, if you\u2019re interested in the process of looking at student work and finding the right question to ask, we are focusing a new set of Professional Development courses on it this year.

Then you go through the edges an confirm that all of them has at least one endpoint in $(v_1,v_2,v_3)$.

Likewise with the five.\n\nThat said, we could come to the conclusion of your statement by, say, basing an argument on how all primes above $3$ are of the form $6n \\pm 1$ (mind you, this follows from an argument akin to the above): the multiples of $6$ begin as follows: $$6, 12, 18, 24, 30\\ldots$$ From which we father that the units of such multiples are either $0, 2, 4, 6$ or $8$. Now take the '$\\pm 1$' bit into consideration and we find that we have the following units possible: $$1, 3, 5, 7, 9$$ (Remember, a remainder of $-1$ when divided by $10$ is equivalent to a remainder of $9$.)\n\nSo, much like the above, we disregard the $5$ since that certainly isn't prime, and we have $1, 3, 7, 9$ leftover, as desired.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nAny natural number $n$ can be expressed as $$n=a_k\\cdot 10^k + a_{k-1}\\cdot 10^{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1\\cdot 10 + a_0$$\n\nfor some natural numbers (including $0$) $k,a_k,\\dots , a_1, a_0$.

Let the feedback vertex number $FVS(G)$ be the minimum number of vertices that have to be deleted from $G$ to break all cycles, so the minimum number of deletions needed to turn $G$ into a forest. Let the max leaf number $MaxLeaf(G)$ be the maximum number of leaves in any spanning tree for $G$.\n\nMy conjecture is that $FVS(G) \\leq MaxLeaf(G)$.\n\nThe two numbers come close for complete graphs: a $K_t$ has a spanning tree with $(t-1)$ leaves, and $(t-2)$ deletions are needed to turn $K_t$ into a forest. Since a forest can have an arbitrary number of leaves and has FVS number 0, the MaxLeaf number cannot be bounded by a function of the FVS number.\n\nI can prove that $FVS(G) \\leq 6 \\cdot MaxLeaf(G)$ through a lemma on spanning trees which says that for every connected graph G containing m vertices of degree $\\neq 2$, there is a spanning tree for G with at least $m/6$ leaves. Since the deletion of the set of vertices of degree $\\neq 2$ turns a graph into a forest if the graph is not a simple cycle, this shows that $FVS(G) \\leq 6 \\cdot MaxLeaf(G)$ when $G$ is not a simple cycle; and it is easy to see that the claim also holds when $G$ is a simple cycle since $MaxLeaf(C_n) = 2$ and $FVS(C_n) = 1$ for $n \\geq 3$.\n\nSince the complement of the leaves in a spanning tree form a connected dominating set, and since the complement of a feedback vertex set is a maximum induced forest, an alternative way to state the conjecture is: For any connected graph $G$ the number of vertices in the largest induced subforest of $G$ is at least as large as the minimum size of a connected dominating set in $G$.\n\nSo my question is: is this conjecture true, and does anyone know of any research related to it?\n\nshare|improve this question\nYou might consider looking at this circle of ideas for planar graphs.

I think it should be possible to prove that FVS(G) < 2 MaxLeaf(G).\n\nMore specifically, if NonTwo(T) is the number of nodes in spanning tree T that do not have degree two, and MaxNonTwo(G) is the maximum value of NonTwo(T) over all spanning trees of G, then I think that\n\n  \u2022 MaxNonTwo(G) < 2 MaxLeaf(G). This is obvious: in any tree, the number of leaves in T is greater than half of NonTwo(T), so the tree T that maximizes NonTwo(T) has greater than NonTwo(T)/2 leaves, and the max leaf spanning tree can only have even more leaves.\n\n  \u2022 FVS(G) \u2264 MaxNonTwo(G). More specifically, in every tree T maximizing NonTwo(T), the set of vertices of degree \u2260 2 form a feedback vertex set. For, if there's a cycle induced by the degree-2 vertices of T, then some edge e of the cycle does not belong to T. If the path in T connecting the endpoints of e passes through a vertex v that does not have degree three, then adding e and removing an edge incident to v produces a tree with a larger value of NonTwo(T). If this situation does not occur, then all edges in the induced cycle are non-tree edges; adding two consecutive edges from the cycle to T and removing two of the edges from T (two of the three edges at the median in T of the endpoints of the added cycle edges) produces a new tree with greater NonTwo again (the three endpoints of the added edges get their degree increased above two, the median goes from degree three to degree one, and two other vertices get their degrees decreased from three to two).\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

Since these polynomials have integer coefficients, their resultant is a rational integer.\n\nThe resultant of two polynomials vanishes whenever they have a common root. So $a(n)=0$ if and only if there exists a $n$th root of unity $u$ such that $(u+1)^n+1=0$. This implies that $u$ and $u+1$ are both roots of unity, in particular they belong to the unit circle, so that necessarily $u=e^{2\\pi i/3}$ or $u=e^{-2\\pi i/3}$, and $u+1=e^{\\pm i\\pi/3}$. If $u$ is a $n$th root of unity, one gets $3|n$; if $(u+1)^n=-1$, one obtains that $n/3$ is odd. Conversely, if $n=3m$ with $m$ odd, $u=e^{2\\pi i/3}$ satisfies $u^n=1$, $u\\neq 1$, and $(u+1)^n=-1$, hence $a(n)=0$.\n\nSince the two polynomials $P$ and $Q$ above are monic, their resultant vanishes mod $p$ if and only if they have a common root when considered as polynomials modulo $p$. If $n=p$ is prime, then $X^n-1=(X-1)^p$, so $1$ is the only root of $P$, with multiplicity $p-1$; it follows that $$\u00a0a(n)\\equiv ((1+1)^p+1)^{p-1}\\equiv (2^p+1)^{p-1}\\equiv 3^{p-1} \\pmod p.$$ If, moreover, $p\\neq 3$, then $a(n)\\equiv 1\\pmod p$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

I don't know if there is any upper bound for the number of shortest path between 2 vertex in a graph.  \nAlso, does any one know if this problem is NP problem or it could be solved in polynomial time?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nup vote 4 down vote accepted\n\nThe problem is NP-complete.\n\nI think that the following algorithm describes a polynomial reduction of SAT to your problem.\n\nLet S be an instance of SAT. So you have a finite set of clauses $C_1$, $C_2$, ...,$C_n$.\nand a finite set of variables $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_k$. Each clause contains some literals, i.e., variables $p_i$ and/or negated variable $\\lnot p_i$. (in 3sat we assume that each clause contains at most 3 literals.) We may assume that for each variable $p$ there is a clause $C_p$ containing only $p$ and $\\lnot p$, so $n\\ge k$.\n\nMake S into a graph as follows: There is a special vertex $ s$. For each variable $p$ there are two vertices $p$ and $\\lnot p$, both connected to $s$ (EDITED to simplify) by an edge. There is a vertex for every clause. Each literal $L$ is connected by an edge to each clause $C$ in which $L$ appears.\n\nThe set $M$ will be the set of all clauses.\n\nIf the original problem S was satisfiable, say with an assignment $A$, then then there is an optimal tree with $n+k$ edges: Connect $s$ with all literals which are true under $A$, and connect each clause $C$ with a literal $L$ in $C$ that is true under $A$.\n\n(EDITED to clarify and to close a gap:) Conversely, if there is an optimal graph with at most $n +k$ edges, then:\n\n  1. Each clause has to be on the tree, so it has to be connected to some literal. This costs $n$ edges.\n\n  2. For each variable $p$, either $p$ or $\\lnot p$ has to be on the tree (because of $C_p$), so either $p$ or $\\lnot p$ has to be connected (by an edge) to $s$ (because the distance has to be $1$). These connections cost $k$ edges.\n\n  3. So from each such pair EXACTLY one is connected with $s$. Those literals which are connected to $s$ now define a satisfying truth assignment.\n\nHence the instance $G,M$ of your problem that I constructed from the SAT problem $S$ has a solution of size at most $n+k$ iff $S$ is satisfiable. So any algorithm to solve your problem also solves SAT. Hence your problem is NP-complete.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks a lot goldstern. I thinks this transformation is correct. I just wonder why we don't connect s directly to each variable instead of going through path o length n. That way we can have a tree of n + k edges, can't we? \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 1:18\nanother problem with this transformation is that you're trying to limit the number of edges while the optimal tree must have minimum number of vertices. With the way you select the tree, the number of vertices is not minimum. \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 5:02\nYou are right, the paths are not necessary. I edited my answer to simplify it (and also to clarify some points). \u2013\u00a0 Goldstern May 8 '11 at 8:19\nI do not understand your question about edges vs vertices. A tree with v vertices has v-1 edges. So you minimize the number of edges iff you minimize the number of vertices. \u2013\u00a0 Goldstern May 8 '11 at 8:20\nMaybe I didn't quite understand your proof. So let me give an example. Let say I have a 3SAT (x+y+z)(x+\u00acy+z). We can assign x=y=z=T. So, if we follow the proof, then we will get a tree with 6 vertices and n+k=2+3=5 edges. However, I can have another smaller tree that can have the same shortest paths to vertices in M={C1, C2}. That tree has 3 edges connecting the vertex representing x with s, C1, and C2. It also has only 4 vertices. Am I missing something here? \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 8:48\n\nJust a rough idea: (I am not really an expert on graph theory, so there may be a much better upper bound.)\n\nYou can group the vertices according to their distance to $s$, say\n\n$L_i=\\{v\\in V|dist(s,v)=i\\}$\n\nThen of course the $L_i$ are pairwise disjoint. Any shortest path from $s$ to a given vertex $v$ has to pass the $L_i$ ascending (you can easily proof this fact), so first a vertex from $L_1$, then one from $L_2$, and so on. That means there are at most $\\prod_{i=1}^{dist(s,v)-1}|L_i|$ shortest paths. As $|L_i|\\leq |V|$, you have a polynomial upper bound.\n\nWhile thinking about it: There might be a way to press this bound much lower, as $|L_i|=|V|$ only happens when all vertices have distance 1, which means the shortest path is the direct connection between $s$ and $v$. For decreasing amount of vertices in the $L_i$, the possible length of the path grows. You probably could use this to get a better bound.\n\nI do not see why the rest of your algorithm should not work.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThank you. I didn't have time to verify your proof here but I think the above transformation is correct. \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 1:19\n\nYour Answer"}

It is somewhat complicated to work with $X$ directly, so we think of $X$ as a sum of simpler variables:\n\nFor $i=1,2,\\ldots10$, let $X_i=\\cases{1 & \\text{if the }i\\text{th pair is matched},\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}.}$\n\nThen each $X_i$ is a Bernoulli variable and $X=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}X_i$.\n\nExpectation is linear, so $$ \\Bbb E(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\,\\Bbb E(X_i). $$\n\nNow we fix $i$ and find $\\Bbb E(X_i) $:\n\nSince $X_i$ is a Bernoulli variable, $\\Bbb E(X_i)=P[X_i=1]$. But the probability that $X_i=1$ is the probability that the $i$th pair was matched. Since it is equally likely that any one of the other 19 shoes is paired with the left shoe of the $i$th pair, $P[X_i=1]={1\\over19}$.\n\nSo $\\Bbb E(X_i)={1\\over19}$.\n\nFinally, we have:\n\n$$\\Bbb E(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\Bbb E(X_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}{1\\over19}=10/19.$$\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI should mention why $P[X_i=1]={1\\over19}$ without \"hand waving\": there are ${20!\\over2^{10}}\\cdot{1\\over10!}$ ways to divide the 20 shoes into pairs and there are ${18!\\over2^9}\\cdot{1\\over9!}$ ways to divide them into pairs with the $i$th pair matched. $P[X_i=1]$ is the ratio of these quantities, which is $1/19$. \u2013\u00a0 David Mitra Nov 14 '11 at 10:15\nInteresting that you're allowed to pair a right shoe with another right shoe.

For example, if I have a probablity of 0.34 of \nwinning a game, I could use Bernoulli trials to tell me my probability \nof winning three out of five.\n\n\"What does this have to do with insurance?\" you may ask. Well, if my \ngame is picking a house, and I win that game if the house is insured, \nwe can use Bernoulli trials to find the probability of \"winning\" 0, 1, \n2, 3, or 4 times. This is also the probability that 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 \nof the houses are insured.\nOne thing that has to be true about our game before we can use \nBernoulli trials is that each play must be independent.

Then the probability that I will win EXACTLY k of these \nn trials is given by\n\n  P(X = k) = (n choose k) * (p^k) * (1 - p)^(n-k)\n\nSo for our problem, if n = 4, and k = 3, and p = .6 we have\n\n  P(X = 3) = (4 choose 3) * (.6^3) * (.4)^1\n           = (4) * (.6^3) * .4\n           = (4) * (.216) * .4\n           = .3456\n\nHowever, this isn't all.

(Remember that k=4.)\n\nThus the probability that at least 3 of the four houses are insured \n\n  P(X=4) + P(X=3) \n\nand you'll see that these are the answers you're looking for.\n\nGood luck, and don't hesitate to write back with more questions.\n\n-Doctor Sonya,  The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nHigh School Probability\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM\n\u00a9 1994-2013 The Math Forum"}

If its first and second partial derivatives exist and continuous its differential is\n\n    dv=\u2202v/\u2202T dT + \u2202v/\u2202P dp.\n\n    an the mixed second partial derivatives are equal:\n\n\n    The integral of dv is independent of he path taken, v is a \"potential\", only if that condition holds.\n\n    In case of the first example, \u2202v/\u2202T=R/P and \u2202v/\u2202P=-RT/P2. The mixed derivatives are equal.\n\n    Now you have \u2202v/\u2202T=R/P, and integrate with respect to T: V=RT/P + integration constant. But that constant can depend on P, so v(T,P)=R/P+f(P). You can find f(P) from the condition that the derivative of v with respect to P has to be -RT/P2:\n    \u2202v/\u2202P= -RT/P2+df/dP=-R/P2, so f=constant.\n\n    Check if the other dv can be the perfect differential of a potential function."}

An external force will come from contact to the external world (or existance of gravity with an external object), and an external torque will have to be produced by that external force.\n\n    Is any part of the system (bullet + block) in contact to the external world (rope, Earth, etc.)?

Jan 30, 2013 #7\n\n\n    User Avatar\n\n    At first I had thought that the correct answer was D. Since as the block moves it feels a force due to the rope (which has a horizontal component after the rope tilts a little) there are external forces and no conservation of linear momentum. Tricky question since you are told to consider a fairly large time interval - momentum is still conserved during and short after the collision, but not a little later as the block moves.\n\n    Mechanical energy is lost in the collision due to deformation, as the bullet sticks inside the block.\n\n    The force due to the rope (the external force), also, always passes through the axis, so it does not produce an external torque and at first I thought angular momentum is conserved. However, taking gravity into account, gravity indeed produces an external torque and therefore no quantity is conserved, so I would say the correct answer is E.\n  9.

Anyhow: if we include gravity - then there is an external force messing with the system. Anything with momentum being conserved will get messed up. That leaves energy - but the collision is inelastic - and \"none of the above\".\n\n    I had misread the question - I thought it referred to the collision at t=0, which is where it usually appears.\n\n    To be super-rigorous, you'd have to construct the equations for each case.\n    However, most of the questions in this paper can be tackled by just going through each of the alternatives one at a time after stopping to think of the processes involved. There's usually two options that look likely, which is where you look harder.\n\nSimilar Discussions: F = MA 2009 # 14 (Momentum Quick Conceptual Question)\n  1. 2009 f=ma #24 (Replies: 1)"}

In the Dover print of the Second Edition this is contained in Page 48 (Section 36), with Sylow Theorems not occurring until section 120 (pages 149-151).\n\nThe argument relies on Cauchy's Theorem; here's the quote. I put in brackets the modern terms for some of the ones used by Burnside.\n\nA group of order $pq$ must contain a subgroup of order $p$ and a subgroup of order $q$. If the latter is not self-conjugate [normal] it must be one of $p$ conjugate sub-groups, which contain $p(q-1)$ distinct operations [elements] of order $q$. The remaining $p$ operations [elements] must constitute a subgroup of order $p$, which is therefore self-conjugate [normal]. A group of order $pq$ has therefore either a self-conjugate subgroup [normal subgroup] of order $p$, or one of order $q$. Take $p\\lt q$, and suppose first that there is a self-conjugate [normal] subgroup $\\{P\\}$ [$\\langle P\\rangle$] of order $p$. Let $Q$ be an operation [element] of order $q$. Then:\n\n$$\\begin{align*} Q^{-1}PQ &= P^{\\alpha}\\\\ Q^{-q}PQ^q &= P^{\\alpha^q},\\\\ \\alpha^q\\equiv 1&\\pmod{p},\\\\ \\text{and therefore }\\alpha\\equiv 1&\\pmod{p}. \\end{align*}$$\n\nIn this case, $P$ and $Q$ are permutable [commute] and the group is cyclical. Suppose secondly that there is no self-conjugate [normal] subgroup of order $p$. There is then necessarily a self-conjugate [normal] subgruop $\\{Q\\}$ of order $q$; and if $P$ is an operation of order $p$, $$\\begin{align*} P^{-1}QP &= Q^{\\beta}\\\\ P^{-p}QP^{p} &= Q^{\\beta^p}\\\\ \\beta^p\\equiv 1 &\\pmod{q}. \\end{align*}$$ If $q\\not\\equiv 1\\pmod{p}$ this would involve $\\beta=1$, and $\\{P\\}$ would be self-conjugate, contrary to supposition. Hence if the group is non-cyclical, $q\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $P^{-1}QP=Q^{\\beta}$, where $\\beta$ is a root, other than unity, of the congruence $\\beta^p\\equiv 1\\pmod{p}$. Between the groups defined by [$E$ is the identity] $$\\begin{align*} P^p&=E, &\\qquad Q^q&=E,&\\qquad P^{-1}QP &= Q^{\\beta},\\\\ \\text{and }P'^p&=E, & Q'^q&=E, & P'^{-1}Q'P'&=Q^{\\beta^a}, \\end{align*}$$ a simple isomorphism is established by taking $P'$ and $P^a$, $Q'$ and $Q$, as corresponding operations [elements]. Hence when $q\\equiv 1\\pmod{p}$ there is a single type of non-cyclical group of order $pq$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIf $Q_1, Q_2$ are two subgroups of order q, then $<Q_1, Q_2> \\supseteq Q_1Q_2$, and so $|<Q_1, Q_2>|\\geq |Q_1Q_2|=q.q/1=q^2 >qp=|G|$, contradiction; so there is unique subgroup of order $q$, hence normal. \u2013\u00a0 Marshal Kurosh Sep 29 '11 at 5:30\n@MarshalKurosh: Perhaps you can contact your local medium and let Burnside know, instead of letting me know? \u2013\u00a0 Arturo Magidin Sep 29 '11 at 13:20\n\nThis solution will mostly use Lagrange and the fact that |G| has so few divisors. This is mostly an example of how looking at cosets and permutations is useful. Sylow's theorem is just an example of doing that in a more general situation. Like Sylow's theorem, we gain a lot by finding fixed points of permutations.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, an element of G has order 1, p, q, or pq. There is only one element of order 1. If there is an element of order pq, then G is the cyclic group generated by it. Otherwise, every non-identity element of G has order p or q, and there is at least one such element, x. Let H be the subgroup generated by x.\n\nCase I: If x has order q, then Lagrange says that there are p cosets of H in G and x acts as a permutation on them. The order of that permutation is either 1 or q (by Lagrange again), but q > p is impossibly big, and so x leaves all the cosets gH alone. That means H is normal in G, because xgH = gH and so g\u22121xg in H for all g in G, and H is generated by x. Let y be any element of G not contained in H. Then y normalizes H, and so conjugation by y is an automorphism of H. The automorphism group of H has order q\u22121, and so the order of that automorphism is a divisor of gcd(q\u22121,\u00a0pq) = 1 by Lagrange, so conjugation by y is the identity automorphism on H. In other words, y\u22121xy = x and xy = yx. In particular, x and y commute and xy has order pq, so G is cyclic.\n\nCase II: If x has order p, then there are q cosets of H in G, by Lagrange. Note that xH = H, so x does not move the coset 1H. We examine two subcases based on whether it leaves any other cosets alone:\n\nCase IIa: Suppose x moves all the other cosets. By Lagrange, those other cosets are collected into p-tuples (the \"orbits\" of x), and so we get that q = 1 + kp, where k is the number of orbits. This explicitly contradicts the non-divisibility hypothesis.\n\nCase IIb: Suppose x leaves at least one more coset alone, say yH for some y not contained in H. In other words, xyH = yH, or y\u22121xy is in H. This means that y acts by conjugation on the elements of H. However, the automorphism group of H has order p\u22121, and so the automorphism by y is a divisor or p\u22121 and a divisor of pq, but gcd(p\u22121,\u00a0pq) = 1. Hence conjugation by y is the identity automorphism: y\u22121xy = x and xy = yx. In particular, x and y commute and xy has order pq, so G is cyclic.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIn Case 1, Why can you claim that $x$ acts as a permutation on the set of left cosets of $H$ ? i.e. suppose $\\{g_1H, \\ldots g_pH\\}$ are left cosets of H, what goes wrong if $xg_iH=xg_jH$ for $1 \\leq i < j \\leq p$ ? \u2013\u00a0 the8thone Oct 14 '14 at 20:31\n\nFor any group $G$ and a normal subgroup $H$, $G$ acts on $H$ by conjugation as automorphisms of $H$. This gives a map from $G \\to \\text{Aut}(H)$ via the permutation representation with kernel $C_G(H)$. So by the First Isomorphism Theorem we have $G/C_G(H) \\hookrightarrow \\text{Aut}(H)$.\n\nNow let $G$ be a group of order $pq$ as above. Clearly if $Z(G)$ is nontrivial then $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, and thus $G$ is abelian. So we may assume that $Z(G) = \\{e\\}$. If every element of $G$ besides the identity has order $q$, then the size of each conjugacy class must be $p$ for every nontrivial element. Then we would have the class equation $pq = 1 + kp$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. But clearly this is impossible as $p$ divides $pq$ but not $1 + kp$. So $G$ must have an element of order $p$, say $g$. Define $H = \\langle x \\rangle$. Then $|G:H| = q$, and since $q$ is the smallest prime dividing $|G|$, we have that $H$ must be normal. So $N_G(H) = G$ and since $Z(G) = \\{e\\}$, we must have that $C_G(H) = H$. Then by the above work, $G/C_G(H) \\hookrightarrow \\text{Aut}(H)$. But since $H$ is cyclic, we have that $\\text{Aut}(H) \\simeq (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ by a standard result in group theory. Since $C_G(H) = H$, $|G/C_G(H)| = q$. But $|\\text{Aut}(H)|=p-1$. Since $G/C_G(H) \\hookrightarrow \\text{Aut}(H)$, this implies that $\\text{Aut}(H)$ has a subgroup of order $q$, but this would imply that $q \\mid p-1$, which is a contradiction. Hence $G$ must be abelian. From here you just need a single element of order $p$ and one of order $q$. Their product has order $pq$ and thus generates $G$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIn your argument you have not used the fact that $p \\neq q$, in fact if $p=q$, A group of order $p^2$ is not necessarily cyclic , i.e. it can be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p$ \u2013\u00a0 the8thone Oct 14 '14 at 20:18\n@the8thone That fact is used in the last line. The product of two elements of order $p$ need not be of order $p^2$. \u2013\u00a0 Brandon Carter Oct 14 '14 at 20:53\n\nLet $G$ be a group of order $pq$. Then order of element should be $1,p,q,pq$.\n\nIt is sufficient to show existance of subgroups of order $p$ and $q$.\n\n  \u2022 If all elements of $G$ are of order $p$ (except identity), then consider a subgroup $H$ of order $p$ and take $y\\in G\\backslash H$, let $K=\\langle y\\rangle$.\n\n    Now $H$ can not be normalised by $y$ in $G$, otherwise $HK$ will be an abelian subgroup of $G$ of order $p^2$, contradiction. Therefore, $yHy^{-1}$ is another conjugate subgroup of order $p$. Now number of conjugates of $H$ will be the index $[G\\colon N(H)]$ of normalizer of $H$ in $G$; since there are at least two conjugates, ($H,yHy^{-1}$) so $[G\\colon N(H)]>1$, we deduce that $N(H)=H$. Therefore there are exactly $q$ conjugates of $H$. The non-trivial elements in collection of conjugates of $H$ will be $(p-1)q$. Then take element $z$ of $G$ outside these counted elements, proceed further for $\\langle z\\rangle$. We will get $(p-1)q$ non-trivial elements in the collection of all conjuagtes of $\\langle z\\rangle$. After some finite steps, say $m\\geq 1$, we will get all non-trivial elements of $G$ (of order $p$); they will be $m(p-1)q$ in number.\n\n    Therefore, $m(p-1)q+1=pq$, which is not valid, since $pq-m(p-1)q$ is divisible by $q$ (here all terms are non-zero).\n\n    Therefore, we conclude that all non-trivial elements of $G$ can-not be of same order $p$.\n\n    Similarly, we can conclude that all non-trivial elements can not have same order $q$.\n\n    \u2022 If $G$ has element of order $pq$ then it will be cyclic.\n\n    \u2022 Otherwise, now we must have atleast one element of order $q$, hence a subgroup $Q$ of order $q$. This subgroup must be be unique (hence normal): if $Q_1$ is another subgroup of order $q$, then $\\langle Q, Q_1\\rangle \\supseteq QQ_1$, so $|\\langle Q,Q_1\\rangle | \\geq |QQ_1|=q.q/1=q^2>qp = |G|$, contradiction.\n\n    Take a subgroup $P$ of order $p$. Now $Q \\triangleleft G$, $P\\leq G$, hence $PQ\\leq G$; in fact this is equality - $PQ=G$ (computing orders). So $G=Q\\rtimes P$. Using two basic theorems on semi-direct product of groups ( Ref. Alperin-Bell - Groups and Representations), we can conclude that $G=Q\\times P$, hence it is cyclic.\n\n    (The crucial step stated in proof is existance of subgroups of order $p$ and $q$. Using theorems on semi-direct products doesn't uses Sylow's theorems.)\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\n(We only consider the complex representation) Suppose that $G$ is non-Abelian. Then there is an irred repr. $\\rho$ s.t. it is $d$-dim'l, $d>1$. By dimension theorem, we get $d=p,q$, or $pq$, but we know that $d$ must be $p$; otherwise by the property that $\\sum_{\\chi'\\in\\text{Irr}(G)}d_\\chi^2=|G|$, we will get $d^2>pq$ because of the condition $p<q$. So the dimension of the irred repr's can only be $1$ or $p$, and hence we get $$ mp^2+n=pq, $$ where $m,n$ stand for the number of $p$-dim'l and $1$-dim'l irred repr's, respectively. Furthermore, let $\\mathcal{L}(G)$ be the set of all $1$-dim'l characters of $G$. Then we have $$ n=|\\mathcal{L}(G)|=|\\text{Irr}(G/[G,G])|=\\frac{|G|}{|[G,G]|}, $$ where $[G,G]$ is the commutator subgroup of $G$. Since $G$ is non-Abelian, $[G,G]$ is nontrivial. So $n=1,p$, or $q$.\n\n[Case 1]: If $n=1$, then $mp^2=pq-1$. So we get $pq\\equiv1\\;(\\text{mod}\\,p^2)$. However, since $q\\equiv 1\\;(\\text{mod}\\,p^2)$, we get $$ pq\\equiv p\\equiv 1 (\\text{mod}\\,p^2), $$ which is a contradiction.\n\n[Case 2]: If $n=p$, then $\\displaystyle m=\\frac{q-1}{p}\\notin\\Bbb N$ because $p\\nmid(q-1)$. Contradiction.\n\n[Case 3]: If $n=q$, then $\\displaystyle m=\\frac{(p-1)q}{p^2}\\notin\\Bbb N$, still a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, in conclusion, we find $G$ must be Abelian, and hence, by the fundamental theorem of Abelian groups, $G\\cong \\Bbb Z_{pq}$ or $\\Bbb Z_p\\times \\Bbb Z_q$. So in any case $G$ is a cyclic group.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

One way, since you've observed that your exponent $x$ is necessarily odd, would be to find all the integral points on the elliptic curves given by the equations $$ y^2 = 13^\\delta u^4+12 \\; \\mbox{ for } \\; \\delta \\in \\{ 1, 3 \\}. $$ One can do this in, for example, magma by typing : IntegralQuarticPoints([13,0,0,0,12]); and IntegralQuarticPoints([13^3,0,0,0,12]); which lead to the two known solutions (with $|u|=1$ and $|y| =5$ and $47$). These routines are using lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms (elliptic, I believe).\n\nAnother approach (which has some similarities) would be to use an argument of de Weger (from his thesis, again based on linear forms in logarithms). This would enable you, for example, to tackle the more general equation $$ 13^x + 2^y 3^z = w^2. $$ I haven't worked out the details, but one should be able to show that the only solutions are with $$ \\begin{array}{r} (x,y,z) = (0,0,1), (0,3,0), (0,3,1), (0,4,1), (0,5,2), (1,0,1), (1,0,5), \\\\ (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (1,2,3), (2,0,3), (2,6,1), (2,10,5), (3,2,1). \\\\ \\end{array} $$\n\nYet another way to solve such problems is to use the hypergeometric method of Thue and Siegel. In this context, it enables one to prove an inequality of the shape $$ \\left| y^2 - 13^x \\right| > |y|^{0.4}, $$ valid for all integers $y$ and odd $x$. Such an approach is also useful for bounding the number of solutions to equations like the one under consideration here. One can, for example, show that given any odd prime $p$ and integer $D$, there are at most $3$ positive integers $x$ such that $$ p^x+D = y^2 $$ for integer $y$. This is, of course, not quite sharp when $p=13$ and $D=12$, but it's close.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI may be two weeks late, but welcome to Math Stack Exchange professor Bennett! \u2013\u00a0 Eric Naslund Feb 7 '13 at 18:59\nThank you, Eric. \u2013\u00a0 Mike Bennett Feb 8 '13 at 1:57\n\n$x=3 \\implies 13^x+12=2209=47^2$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nI don't think there's a nice way to do this.

Show that its radius shrinks at a constant rate. If it melts to 8/27 of its original volume in 20 minutes, how long will it take to melt completely? Please I need your help.\n\n\nHi Jay.\n\nLet's take this question step by step: first, the \"snowball melts at a rate...\" is clearly referring to the change in volume of the snowball with respect to time. If V = volume,\nA = surface area and R = radius, then dV/dt is what this phrase means.\n\nNow \"...proportional to its surface area.\" means that the dV/dt (the first part of the sentence) varies directly with the surface area A. Varies directly just means that the two terms are equal, but there is a constant of proportionality (usually called k) as a factor (usually attached to the second term). That means:\n\ndV/dt = kA.\n\nSo that's all the first sentence says.\n\nThe question is \"show that the radius shrinks at a constant rate\". That means the change in radius with respect to time is constant (let's call this constant q). So that means you are asked to show dr/dt is some constant.\n\nThe way to do this is to know the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere:\n\nV = (4/3) \u03c0 r3 and A = 4 \u03c0 r2\n\nand take derivatives.\n\ndV/dt is the derivative of volume with respect to time, but remember that r is also changing, so you have to use the chain rule:\n\ndV/dt = d/dt((4/3) \u03c0 r3) = (4/3) \u03c0 3 r2 (dr/dt)\n\nNow let's plug that into the first equation:\n\n(4/3) \u03c0 3 r2 (dr/dt) = k A = k(4 \u03c0 r2) = 4 \u03c0 k r2\n\nSo when we simplify by dividing left and right sides by 4 \u03c0 r2, we get:\n\ndr/dt = k\n\nwhich is saying exactly what we wanted to prove: that dr/dt is constant.\n\nFor the second (numerical) part of the question, you don't know the\noriginal volume (call it V again), but hopefully it will cancel out\nlater, so just start with what you know. Call the original radius R,\nthe radius after 20 minutes r, and the volume after 20 minutes v,.\n\nV = 4/3 \u03c0 R3\nv = 4/3 \u03c0 r3\nv = (8/27)V\n\nNow use this last equation to tie together the two volume equations:\n\n4/3 \u03c0 r3 = (8/27) (4/3 \u03c0 R3)\n\nso when you simplify and take the cube root,\n\nr = 2/3 R\n\nThat's very useful, because it is saying that the new radius is 2/3 the initial radius. But since the change in radius with respect to time is constant, the radius is shrinking at a constant rate.

I think what you're really saying is that you want some set $T$ such that for every $s \\in S$ there is some $t \\in T$ with $d_h(s,t) \\le 3$. There are lots of such sets, for example $S$ itself.

Although we could phrase your distance in terms of the symmetric distance of two sets, I think it easier to say \"For any 5-set t, I want there to be at least one of my 5-sets s in S such that s intersect t has at least two elements. Further, I want S chosen so that S has as few 5-sets in it as can be managed.\" The La Jolla Covering Repository answers this sort of question (if I read it right).

Gerhard \"Donates Regularly To Mega Millions\" Paseman, 2011.06.06 \u2013\u00a0Gerhard Paseman Jun 7 '11 at 1:44\nYou are asking for a wheel with parameters $(50,5,2)$.

You have 50 points. $S$ is the set of all $\\binom{50}{5}=2118760$ selections of 5 points. You want a subset $B \\subset S$ such that any $s \\in S$ intersects at least one $b \\in B$ in at least 2 points. That is an interesting problem and does not immediately strike me as familiar. Call a member of $B$ a block. A given block intersects $152026$ members of $S$ in 2 or more points. This gives a lower bound of $14$ for the possible size of $B$. Of course this a weak bound since two disjoint blocks determine $200$ members of $S$ intersecting one in 2 points and the other in 3 and another $4000$ intersecting each in 2 points. If my calculations are correct, that raises the lower bound to at least $19$ blocks. I doubt that $20$ would suffice.\n\nSo far my record is 44 blocks.\n\nLet me digress for some terminology (which I'll try to keep fairly standard). a design is a pair $D=(V,B)$ where $V$ is a set of $v$ vertices and a $B$ is a collection of subsets called blocks There are various names for designs which satisfy additional conditions. Two are\n\nEvery pair of points is in exactly one common block. (Then $D$ is called a linear space)\n\nEvery pair of points is in at least one common block and every block has the same number $k$ of points. (Then $D$ is called a $(v,k,2)$-covering design and the La Jolla Repository has information about these.)\n\nWhen both conditions hold, $D$ is called a Steiner System $S(2,k,v).$ Many that one encounters arise from algebraic constructions. This is perhaps due to the Streetlight effect.\n\nI'll coin the term super-linear space for a design such that every pair of points from $V$ occur in at least one common block but the blocks may have various sizes (since I don't know a standard name. It turns out that this might be called a lottery wheel although that term is not very specific)\n\nYou have $50$ points and do not require that every pair of points is in a block but do wish that from every 5 points (element of $S$), at least one pair is in at least one block. You also want all blocks to have $5$ points. I'll find it convenient to only require that each block have at most 5 points, then one can arbitrarily enlarge blocks to size 5.\n\nAll my constructions have this form: Split the points into 4 groups (or 2 or 3) and for each group take a super-linear space with no block having more than 6 points. Then any element of $S$ has two points in the same group and those two points are in a common block. Perhaps one can do better without this restriction. I include a few other possibilities in case it inspires anyone to get a better result.\n\n44* blocks. Split into 4 groups of size 21,21,4 and 4. For each of the large groups take the 21 lines of a projective plane of order 4 and let the two small groups be 4 point blocks. Now any set in $S$ has at least two points in a common group and those two pints determine a unique block.\n\n60 blocks: split the points into two sets of 25 and use the 30 lines of an affine plane of order 5 on each. This is overkill because any 3 element set has two points in some block. Perhaps there is a way to cull out some of the lines.\n\nUnder 52 blocks If the points are partitioned into 3 groups of 13 and one of 11 (with two fake points added in) then (for each group) the lines of a projective plane of order 3 were taken as blocks this would give a solution with 52 blocks of size 4. Delete $X,Y$ to improve this to 45 of size 4 and 6 of size 3 and one of size two. Now tack the block of size 2 onto a block of size 3 to get $51$ blocks (one of size 5). (If $X,Y$ are in different groups it might be better, I haven't checked.) One can also get rid of at least 3 more blocks as follows: take a block abcd, delete it and add b as a fifth point to a block containing c and another containing c, add c as a fifth point to two blocks containing d and a and add d as a fifth point to two blocks containing a and b.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nThanks a lot! How would you recommend to build the projective 3 space of order 4? I think I'm currently not ready for this task :(. \u2013\u00a0chous Jun 7 '11 at 12:18\nAaron Meyerowitz's construction for $42$ blocks used $F_3$ rather than $F_4$, which should make it easier. The construction is just like that of $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ so that the points are lines passing through the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ and the lines of $\\mathbb{P}^3$ correspond to (two-dimensional) planes passing through the origin. $\\mathbb{P}^3(F_4)$ has $(4^4-1)/(4-1)=85$ points, though. \u2013\u00a0Douglas Zare Jun 7 '11 at 17:53\n$\\mathbb{P}^3(F_3)$ has ${40 \\choose 2}/{4 \\choose 2} = 130$ lines, not $40$, so the construction for $42$ blocks actually uses $132$ blocks. It was a little too good to be true since it would mean any quadruple would intersect a block in $2$ points, and it would be easy to use the $5$th points to make a line redundant. \u2013\u00a0Douglas Zare Jun 7 '11 at 18:40\n\nHere is a construction of size $38$. Call the points cards and divide the deck into $4$ suits, so that $2$ suits have ranks $1,...,13$ and $2$ suits have ranks $1,...,12$. Every hand of $5$ cards must have at least $2$ cards in some suit. So, if we cover all possible pairs in each suit, the result will be a wheel.\n\nThe La Jolla Covering Repository says that $C(12,5,2)=9$ so we can cover all pairs within the short suits with $9$ hands each:\n\n1  2  4  7  9 \n1  3  4  6 12 \n1  3  7 10 11 \n1  5  6  8 12 \n2  3  5  7  8 \n2  6 10 11 12 \n3  6  7  9 12 \n4  5  8 10 11 \n5  8  9 10 11 \n\nSimilarly, it says $C(13,5,2) \\le 10$ so we can cover all pairs within the long suits with $10$ hands each:\n\n1  2  3  4  5\n1  6  7  8  9\n1 10 11 12 13\n2  3  6  7 10\n2  3  8  9 11\n4  5  6  7 11\n4  5  8  9 10\n2  3  4 12 13\n5  6  7 12 13\n1  8  9 12 13\n\nThe total is $38$ hands which intersect each hand of $5$ cards in at least $2$ cards. So, $L(50,5,5,2) \\le 38$.\n\nEdit: The best this method can do with the coverings known in the La Jolla Repository is $37$. That can be done by splitting a $50$ card deck into suits of sizes $(17, 11, 11, 11),$ $(13,13,13,11)$, or $(15, 13, 11, 11)$.\n\n$C(17,5,2) \\le 16$.\n\n$C(15,5,2) \\le 13$.\n\n$C(13,5,2) \\le 10$ as shown above.\n\n$C(11,5,2) \\le 7$.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nThanks (truly!) for clarifying the question and making my LJCR comment less useful (since a covering design was not wanted) and also more useful (by showing how two covering designs could help).

In the solution with suits of size 11,11,11,17 and covering designs of sizes 7,7,7,16, each covering design has a block which can be reduced to 3 cards. Take the 3 card blocks abc def ghi jkl and replace them by abcjk defjl ghikl. In fact one of the pairs from jkl ( in the 17 card suit) has a pair already covered so one could leave one of the hands with three cards. \u2013\u00a0Aaron Meyerowitz Jun 10 '11 at 5:38\n\nYour Answer"}

{"problem": "Given m points on a unit sphere, find a lower bound on the maximum number of points that can be contained in a disk of radius r on the sphere, where r is less than \u03c0.", "final_answer": "ma/A", "raw_text": "Retrieved from http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/156218/covering-points-on-a-sphere-with-a-disk?answertab=oldest\nText:\nTake the 2-minute tour \u00d7\n\nSuppose $m$ points (\"sites\") are selected on the unit sphere $S^2$. For a given radius $r < \\pi$, we can define a disk around any point on the sphere as the set of points at geodesic distance at most $r$ from it. Let $k$ be the maximum number of sites contained in any such disk. Is there a nice lower bound on $k$ in terms of $r$? In other words, what should the function $k(r)$ be so that, no matter where the $m$ sites are placed, we can always find a disk of radius $r$ containing $k(r)$ of them?\n\nI would hope it is simply $m$ times the fraction of the surface area of the sphere covered by a disk. After all, if the average density of sites on the sphere is $m/A$, there must be some disk whose density is at least the average, right? This would be easily proved if you could tile the sphere with disks with no overlap, but you can't, so I'm not sure. If it turns out to depend on the packing density of disks on a sphere, I'll be happy with a reasonable lower bound.\n\nIf you replace the unit sphere and the disks with unit ball and smaller balls of radius $r < 1$ in $\\mathbb R^3$, and the area ratio with the volume ratio, then the naive guess doesn't work. You can have $m/2$ sites clustered around one point near the surface of the unit ball and the other $m/2$ sites around the antipodal point, so that for $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac1{2}} < r < 1$, the volume of a ball of radius $r$ is more half that of the unit ball, but you can't get more than $m/2$ sites inside it. Perhaps it still works in some asymptotic sense; I'm curious about anything rigorous that can be said in this case too.\n\nFinally, although I've stated the above question for the 2-sphere and ball in $\\mathbb R^3$, I'm also interested in the generalization to higher dimensions.\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nIt turns out that the answer to my first question is really very simple.\n\nSuppose you pick the center of the disk randomly from a uniform distribution on the sphere. Appealing to symmetry, we may infer that the probability that a given site lies within the disk is precisely the fraction of the surface area of the sphere covered by the disk; if the areas of the disk and the sphere are $a$ and $A$ respectively, this probability is $a/A$. By linearity of expectation, the expected number of sites contained in a randomly chosen disk is $ma/A$. Therefore, there must exist some disk which contains at least this many points.\n\nThe second question remains open, namely the problem of covering as many as possible of $m$ sites in a unit ball with a smaller ball of radius $r < 1$.\n\nEdit: I hate to edit merely to bump this to the front page, but I wanted to use this solution to answer another question on math.SE, and I'd rather not do that if it has a negative score. For all I know, it might have an error that I haven't noticed.

Taking the logarithm to the base 10 of n!. If the log comes out to be x, it is not hard to see that the number of digits must be the lowest integer greater than or equal to x, i.e, $floor(x)+1$. Now the question comes down to approximating the $log(n!)$ It is possible to prove by induction that n! lies between $(\\frac{n}{2})^n$ and $(\\frac{n}{3})^n$. Thus the log(n!) lies between $nlog(\\frac{n}{2})$ and $nlog(\\frac{n}{3})$. We can get a pretty tight bound if we used log tables for log(20/3), but as you have disallowed that, using the upper limit(which becomes log(10) = 1) will do quite nicely too. The answer comes to 20*log(10) = 20, which should tell you that the expected number of digit is about 19 or 20.(Since 20 is only the upper bound).

If AC fails, then no x can have C(x). Thus, ZF+\u00acAC proves that no x has C(x).\n\nBut ZFC proves that C(0) holds, and so it proves that Q={0} is the desired set.\n\n\nThe set { x | C(x) } is an indicator set for AC, in the sense that it is either 0 or 1, depending exactly on whether AC holds. A similar trick works to construct indicator sets for any assertion.\n\nI have suggested that the question be focused on the possibility of projective statements C(x). A projective statement is one expressible in the language of second order number theory, with quantifiers over real numbers and natural numbers. Thus, the question would be whether there is a specific projective statement C(x) such that ZFC proves that Q = { x | C(x) } is nonempty, but ZF does not.\n\nThis version of the question is exactly equivalent to the question of whether ZFC is not conservative over ZF for projective sentences, since if there is a counterexample C(X), then the assertion $\\exists x C(x)$ is provable in ZFC but not ZF, and if $\\sigma$ is provable in ZFC but not in ZF, then the set {x | $\\sigma$} is ZFC provably all of the reals, but ZF is consistent with this set being empty.\n\nTherefore, the question amounts to: Is ZFC not conservative over ZF for projective statements?\n\nI think it is not, but I don't have a counterexample.\n\nMeanwhile, I can say that if one replaces ZF here with ZF+DC, looking at the difference between the full Axiom of Choice and the Axiom of Dependent Choices, rather than at the difference between full AC and no AC at all, then the answer is that it IS conservative. In this MO answer, I explained that ZFC is conservative over ZF+DC for projective sentences, and so if one replaces ZF with ZF+DC in the question, the answer would be no. But without DC, weird things can happen in the reals, and I'm not yet quite sure about it.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIn this case, the formula asserting that there is such a nonempty Q is exactly equivalent to AC. You could replace AC in this argument with any statement whatsoever; what you get is a kind of indicator set for the truth of that statement. It is empty when the statement fails, and it is 1 when the statement holds. \u2013\u00a0 Joel David Hamkins Apr 22 '10 at 20:05\nI take this answer to show that you will want to revise your question.

Oh well. :) Since it doesn't make a big difference, I'll just leave it alone. \u2013\u00a0 Bill Cook Dec 18 '11 at 18:46\n\nNow that you have a generating function proof (so you know the result is true), you may wonder if you can actually map partitions of one kind bijectively to those of the other kind. Motivated by this other question, the following idea comes to mind: starting with a partition in which no part $d$ is repeated $d$ times or more, in order to get rid of square parts, break any part $x^2$ into $x$ parts equal to $x$, and repeat. Since there were no parts equal to $1$ this terminates, producing a partition without square parts.\n\nWe must show that every partition of without square parts is produced exactly once from a partition in which no part $d$ is repeated more $d$ times or more. We can treat non-squares separately: if $k>1$ is a non-square, then the parts in the original partition that would have been broken up eventually into parts of size $k$ are those of size $k$, $k^2$, $k^4$, $k^8$, ..., $k^{2^i}$,... Supposing the multiplicity of $k$ in the final partition is $m$, we must decompose $$ mk=c_0k+c_1k^2+c_2k^4+\\cdots+c_ik^{2^i}+\\cdots \\quad\\text{with $c_i<k^{2^i}$ for all $i\\in\\mathbf N$} $$ But this is uniquely possibly by the expression of $mk$ in the mixed radix number system with place values $1,k,k^2,k^4,k^8,\\ldots$ (the initial $1$ is only there to have a number system capable of expressing all natural numbers; $mk$ being a multiple of $k$ has digit $0$ on this least significant position.) Concretely one can find the $c_i$ either in order of increasing $i$ by taking remainders modulo the next $k^{2^{i+1}}$, or by decreasing $i$ by allocating the largest chunks first and then using smaller chunks for what is left of $mk$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks for this other argument, Marc van Leeuwen. \u2013\u00a0 Noel Dec 19 '11 at 7:05\nSee Wilf's Lectures on Integer Partitions for more on bijections like this. \u2013\u00a0 David Bevan Dec 19 '11 at 8:56\n@David Bevan: Thank you for the reference.

For every such $x$, one has $50\\%$ chances that the first step is to $x+1$ and $50\\%$ chances that the first step is to $x-1$, and from there, one looks for the probability $u(x\\pm1)$ to hit $x_1$ before $x_0$. Hence, $u(x)=\\frac12(u(x+1)+u(x-1))$.\n\nThis means that $x\\mapsto u(x)$ is a straight line on the integer interval $[x_0,x_1]$. Obviously, $u(x_0)=0$ and $u(x_1)=1$ hence $u(x)$ is as written above.\n\nA slightly more advanced method is to consider the position $X_n$ of the random walk at time $n\\wedge\\tau_0\\wedge\\tau_1$ where $\\tau_0$ is the first hitting time of $x_0$ and $\\tau_1$ is the first hitting time of $x_1$. This means that the random walk performs equiprobable independent $\\pm1$ steps and that one stops it as soon as it hits $x_0$ or $x_1$. Then $(X_n)$ is a bounded martingale hence its expectation does not depend on $n$. Now $X_0=x$, $X_n\\to x_1$ on $S=[\\tau_1<\\tau_0]$, $X_n\\to x_0$ on $[\\tau_0<\\tau_1]=S^c$, and one gets $$ x=X_0=\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}E(X_n)=E(\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}X_n)=x_0P(S^c)+x_1P(S). $$ Since $P(S)+P(S^c)=1$, this yields the result.\n\nIn the Brownian motion case, one can still use the idea of the second method, replacing finite differences by a differential operator: one gets that $u(x_0)=0$, $u(x_1)=1$ and $u''(x)=0$ for every real number $x$ in the interval $(x_0,x_1)$. This means that $u$ is affine in this case as well hence $u(x)$ is given by our first displayed formula, where now the argument $x$ is a real number.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

One way to achieve this is to place a rook in position $(i,j,k)$ if and only if $i+j+k=0\\mod n$. In general, there are \"many\" ways to do this.\n\nEach such \"attack-free\" rook position can be colored with $c$ colors. When we fix an $i$, we can then count the colors in the matrix $(i,.,.)$, and can do similarly for each $j$ and $k$. Call this set of tuples of colors-counts the \"color profile\". For each color profile, there is either an even or odd number of colored rook positions that achieve it. I want to know the largest $c$ such that all color profiles have an even number of colored rook positions achieving it. In particular, I want to say that $c=\\omega(n)$.

I state it with $d\\ge3$ because I can solve the $d=2$ case exactly. In particular\n\nFor each $n$, for any $c\\le n-1$, and any color profile $P$ on grid $[n]^2$, $N(P)\\equiv 0 \\mod 2$. For $c\\ge n$, there are profiles $P$ where $N(P)\\equiv 1\\mod 2$.\n\nThis can be proven by exhibiting a bijection between colored rook sets (which in d=2 are just permutation matrices). Specifically, using the pigeonhole principle $c\\le n-1$ implies that there are two rooks with the same color. If they were at positions $(i,j)$ and $(i',j')$, then we replace them with the rooks of the same color at positions $(i,j')$ and $(i',j)$. (Of course, one needs to make this well-defined to ensure a bijection.)\n\nPossible Methods\n\nI see two possible methods of proof\n\n  \u2022 generalize the above bijection proof to the 3-dimensional case\n\n    \u2022 I don't know how to use the pigeonhole principle to get such an extension, but it seems possible that there is a method to show that some motif exists in any colored rook set, and then argue that we can alter this motif to get the bijection\n  \u2022 define a system of polynomials (over $\\mathbb{F}_2$) such that the solution set corresponds to exactly the colored rook sets inducing a color profile $P$. Then try to apply the Chevalley-Warning theorem.\n\n    \u2022 I've tried this, but can't seem to get systems of polynomials where the sum of the total degrees is strictly less than the number of variables, so the C-W theorem does not apply.\n    \u2022 One can observe the the C-W theorem is an \"iff\" here: if $N(P)$ is even then there is a multilinear polynomial with degree strictly less than the number of variables, such that the solution set encodes those $C_S$'s that induce $P$.\n  \u2022 Instead of using \"rook sets\", one can ask the question for other classes of subsets of $[n]^3$.

For example:\n\n123       100 010 001\n231  <->  001 100 010\n312       010 001 100\n\nA colouring of the Latin square is a partition of its entries (corresponding to a coloured rook set).\n\nWe can therefore readily construct colour profiles P with c=n2 such that N(P)=1 (that is, by partitioning some Latin square into n2 parts). But we can do much better...\n\nA defining set is a partial Latin square with a unique completion. A critical set is a minimal defining set. Let scs(n) be the size of a smallest critical set for Latin squares of order n. From a Latin square L containing a critical set of size scs(n), we can choose a partition (i.e. a c-colouring) such that the entries in the critical set are in parts of size 1 and the remaining entries of L are in a single part. This also will give rise to a colour profile P in which N(P)=1. It has been shown that scs(n)\u2264n2/4 for all n. (see J. Cooper, D. Donovan and J. Seberry, Latin squares and critical sets of minimal size, Australasian J. Combin 4 (1991), 113\u2013120.) Hence we can deduce that for some c<=n2/4+1 we have N(P)\u22611 (mod 2). But with a more intelligent choice of the partition, we can do better...\n\nIn fact, we can use the constructions in Cooper et al. to construct a colour profile P with c=n for which N(P)=1. I will only be able to prove this by example here (but it should be clear it can be readily generalised): Partition the \"back circulant\" Latin square of order 6 as follows.\n\n123456     100000   020000   003000   000000   000000   000456\n234561     000000   200000   030000   000000   000000   004561\n345612 <-> 000000 + 000000 + 300000 + 000000 + 000000 + 045612\n456123     000000   000000   000000   000000   000000   456123\n561234     000000   000000   000000   000004   000000   561230\n612345     000000   000000   000000   000040   000005   612300\n\nNow observe that the three colour profiles are:\n\n100005  111003  111003\n020004  011004  011004\n003003  001005  001005\n000204  000006  000006\n000015  000105  000105\n000006  000114  000114\n\nTogether these form P. Given P, we can observe that any Latin square of order 6 with colour profile P must contain the following partial Latin square:\n\n\nWhich is a critical set -- and therefore admits a unique completion (that is, to the \"back circulant\" Latin square of order 6). Therefore, if c=n there exists a color profile P for which N(P)=1, not just N(P)\u22611 (mod 2).\n\nEDIT: I presented this problem to our research group at Monash and we improved the upper bound to c=1 (which was a bit surprising!). The idea came from the following critical set (call it C) of the back-circulant Latin square, which is related to the one above, but contains more entries than the one above (but this doesn't matter for this problem).\n\n\nWe observed that if every entry in the critical set above is assigned one colour, and the remaining entries another colour, then there is a unique Latin square with that colour profile. That is, we derive the colour profile from in the following way.\n\n123456     12345.   .....6\n234561     2345..   ....61\n345612 <-> 345... + ...612\n456123     45....   ..6123\n561234     5.....   .61234\n612345     ......   612345\n\nwhich gives rise to the following colour profile P:\n\n15   51   51\n24   42   42\n33   33   33\n42   24   24\n51   15   15\n06   06   06\n\nWe can deduce that any Latin square with the colour profile P will, in fact, contain the critical set C. Hence, N(P)=1.\n\nTo see how we deduce the critical set from the colour profile, we note that for the first colour, it contains 5 entries in the first row and column, 4 entries in the second row and column, and so on (and the same for columns). This selection of cells can take only one shape -- that is, it is unique. Then placing the symbols 1..5 in it can only be achieved in one way (to preserve the Latin property).\n\nSince this can be generalised for all n\u22652, the answer to your question \"what is the largest c such that for all colour profiles P, N(P)\u22610 (mod 2)\" is c=1.\n\nEDIT 2: We also discussed at our research meeting the complexity side of the problem.\n\nInstance: colour profile P\n\nQuestion: is N(P)\u22651?\n\nIn fact, there is an easy way to see that this problem is NP-complete, since (a) we can embed instances of the problem of partial Latin square completion in the above problem and (b) a Latin square together with its colouring can be used as a certificate.\n\nThe problem of partial Latin square completion was shown to be NP-complete in: C. J., Colbourn, The complexity of completing partial Latin squares, Discrete Appl.

If the ribbon was on a spindle of radius, say, 1 inch, the sum would be (16/16 + 17/16 + ... + 32/16). An interesting related problem is find (and prove) a formula for ( 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N ) John Hawley\n\nHere is another approach. If we assume that the ribbon is tightly wound up (i.e., no gaps between the layers of ribbon), then the volume occupied by the 'disk' of wound-up ribbon equals the volume of the unwound strip (a very flat and long 'box'). Let R denote the radius of the 'disk', T the thickness of the ribbon, L its unwound length (the quantity we want to compute), and W its width. The wound-up volume is pi*R^2*W (\"R^2 means \"R squared\"), and the unwound volume is L*W*T. Setting these equal and solving for L, we get L = pi*R^2/T. For the values given (R=2 in., T=1/16 in.), we get L = 64*pi (about 201) inches. By the way, your idea of using a spiral would work. One could write an equation (polar coordinates would be the easiest choice) for a curve that would lie within the ribbon-say, at mid- interior. There is a formula for length of a curve, using integral calculus. As it happens, the answer you get is the same as that obtained above. If you would like more details on this calculus approach, please ask (here or via e- mail).\n\nRon Winther\n\nClick here to return to the Mathematics Archives\n\n\n\nEducational Programs\nBuilding 360\n9700 S.

Since the TSP route is not allowed to repeat vertices, once the greedy algorithm chooses $a,b,c,d$, it is forced to take the longest edge $d,a$ to return to the starting city.\n\n\nAs it already turned out in the other replies, your suggestion does not effectively solve the Travelling Salesman Problem, let me please indicate the best way known in the field of heuristic search (since I see Dijkstra's algorithm somewhat related to this field of Artificial Intelligence).\n\nA heuristic algorithm can return optimal solutions (though the sizes it can manage are relatively small as a matter of fact) and the following method was suggested by Richard Korf in the 90s. While it works perfectly for the symmetric travelling salesman problem (where the cost of the edge $(u,v)$ equals the cost of the same edge when traversed in the opposite direction $(v,u)$), it can be easily adapted to the alternative case of the asymmetric version.\n\nThe best approach (I am aware of) consists of running a Depth-First Branch-and-Bound heuristic search algorithm where the heuristic is the cost of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Since the MST can be computed in polynomial time with either the Prim's algorithm or the Kruskal's algorithm, then it can be expected to return solutions in a reasonable amount of time. For a wonderful discussion of these two algorithms I do strongly suggest you to have a look at The Algorithm Design Manual\n\nAs a matter of fact, let me highlight that since this approach was suggested not much progress have been seen in the field for deriving optimal bounds of this problem so that I do consider it to be a hot question in the field of combinatorial search.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\nI have no idea how anyone here didn't notice that the application of Dijkstra's algorithm would be entirely unnecessary in this case? You could implement this greedy algorithm by simply selecting the closest node, which is known apriori. Dijkstra's algorithm is used for discovering paths, but you are only taking a single step each time. This obviously does not find the optimal solution to the TSP, but many very good approaches do not find it either. All optimal solution finders for TSP are very computationally demanding.\n\n\nThe answer is no, that's not a good way of solving the TSP problem. A good counter example is where all the points are on a line, like the following:\n\n\nusing Dijsktra's algorithm, would make the poor salesman starting at point 0, first go to 1 then to 2 then to 3 ect. which is not the optimal.\n\nHope that helps. Have a look at the first chapter in Steven S. Skiena excellent book called \"The Algorithm Design\" it explains this example in more detail.\n\nThe TSP problem is not finding the shortest way between two points, but in making a route between all the points which are optimal. When you have the optimal route you can use Dijsktra to find the shortest path between each points in the route.\n\n  \u2022 2\n    $\\begingroup$ Dijkstra is a single source shortest path algorithm, but it wouldn't \"make\" the salesman start at 0, nor would it return a route.

For example, if you needed the K of hearts to complete all $13$ hearts but you also have seen $5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,K,K,K$ so far with no other quads seen yet that hand. The K of hearts would satisfy both conditions simultaneously and thus create a \"tie\" (no decision) situation, prompting a reshuffle and retrial.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ What is a \"quad\"? $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0K.

We generate all the distributions of cards into ranks, ${13+4\\choose4}=2380$ except the distributions that lack $3$ cards of any rank, ${13+3\\choose3}=560$. Then for each distribution we can compute the probability of having that distribution given a hand of that many cards, $$P_{dist}=\\frac{\\frac{13!}{n_0!n_1!n_2!n_3!n_4!}{4\\choose0}^{n_0}{4\\choose1}^{n_1}{4\\choose2}^{n_2}{4\\choose3}^{n_3}{4\\choose4}^{n_4}}{{52\\choose0\\cdot n_0+1\\cdot n_1+2\\cdot n_2+3\\cdot n_3+4\\cdot n_4}}$$ Where $n_i$ is the number of ranks that have $i$ cards in the distribution. Then we multiply that by the probability of ending a game requiring $n_4+1$ quads on the next card, $$P_{over}=\\frac{n_3}{52-(0\\cdot n_0+1\\cdot n_1+2\\cdot n_2+3\\cdot n_3+4\\cdot n_4)}$$ Now we have to find the probabilities of winning on that next card, drawing, or already having lost. $$\\begin{align}P_{win}&=P(0)\\\\ P_{tie}&=\\frac14P(1)\\\\ P_{lose}&=\\frac34P(1)+P(2)+P(3)+P(4)\\end{align}$$ Where $P(i)$ is the probability of having completed $i$ suits after the next card has been drawn. Then by inclusion-exclusion, we can find that $$\\begin{align}P(0)&=1-4P(\\spadesuit)+6P(\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)-4P(\\diamondsuit\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)+P(\\clubsuit\\diamondsuit\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)\\\\ P(1)&=4P(\\spadesuit)-12P(\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)+12P(\\diamondsuit\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)-4P(\\clubsuit\\diamondsuit\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)\\\\ P(2)&=6P(\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)-12P(\\diamondsuit\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)+6P(\\clubsuit\\diamondsuit\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)\\\\ P(3)&=4P(\\diamondsuit\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)-4P(\\clubsuit\\diamondsuit\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)\\\\ P(4)&=P(\\clubsuit\\diamondsuit\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)\\end{align}$$ Where, for example $P(\\heartsuit\\spadesuit)=P_2$ is the probability of having completed both the hearts and spades suits by the time the next card is drawn. Having picked $K$ specific suits, the probability of all of those suits being present in a rank where $N$ cards has been drawn is $$P_{NK}=\\frac{{4-K\\choose N-K}}{{4\\choose N}}$$ Where ${N\\choose k}=0$ if $k<0$. So the probability of success over all ranks is $$P_K=P_{0K}^{n_0}P_{1K}^{n_1}P_{2K}^{n_2}P_{3K}^{n_3-1}P_{4K}^{n_4+1}$$ Where conventionally $0^0=1$.

Jan 29, 2014 #2\n    The pressure will be the same.\n\n    Just look at the ideal gas law:\n\n    PV = nRT, here P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of molecules and T is the temperature. R is just a constant.\n\n    Solving for P you get:\n\n    P = nRT / V\n\n    Now, right after you close the lid on each container, notice that the number of molecules in each container is directly proportional to the volume of the container. Therefore the pressure will be the same. When you increase the temperature, it is proportional to the pressure in both cases, so when you increase the temperature equally much in both containers, you increase the pressure equally much. So the end pressure is the same.\n  4. Jan 29, 2014 #3\n    Thanks... this is how I see it as well... but I'm in disagreement with a PhD about it... (I'm not one, so I have less cred), so I appreciate the sanity check.\n\n    I just think of a (very tough) soap bubble in a pressure cooker.\n\n    If you add or subtract heat... he would have to believe that the bubble would change size one way or the other as you changed temperature.\n\n    Intuitively, I just couldn't see that happening. The gas would become equally more active on both sides of the bubble, so the bubble would retain its size. The only way to change the bubble size would be to add or remove gas.... so even if the bubble was slowly permeable... there would be no net exchange (discounting surface tension of the bubble, of course :)\n    Last edited: Jan 29, 2014\n  5.

Sep 17, 2005 #4\n\n\n    User Avatar\n    Science Advisor\n\n    What was the question?? I think you have two equations in 4 unknowns and both equations are equal to 0. (It is mildly confusing that you tell us the variables are X1, X2, X3, X4 but then write x1, x2, x3, and x4!)\n\n    Do you understand that there are many different ways to write the answer depending on exactly how you do this? It might be that your answers that are \"far away from the answer\" are, in fact, exactly on the answer!\n\n    You could do this by \"row reducing\" but with a simple problem like this I think just \"substitution\" is best.\n\n    The equations are 3x1+ x2+ x3+ x4= 0 and 5x1- x2+ x3- x4= 0. I might do something like add the two equations and get 8x1+ 2x3= 0 so that x3= -4x1.\n    Now, I choose (arbitrarily) to make x1= s. Then x3= -4s. Putting those into the two equations I get 3s+ x2- 4x+ x4= 0 or x2+ x4= s and\n    5s- x2- 4s- x4= 0 or x2+ x4= s. Since those two equations are exactly the same, I choose (again arbitrarily) to let x2= t and solve for x4= s-t.\n    My solution is x1= s, x2= t, x3= -4s, x4= s-t.\n\n    Is that \"far away from the answer\", which was x1= -s x2=-t-s x3=4s x4 = t? No, not at all. It might make a little more sense if I don't use the same letters as in your given answer: In my answer use \"u\" instead of \"s\" and \"v\" instead of \"t\". Then my answer is x1= u, x2=v, x3=-4u, x4= u- v. Looking at the \"given\" answer, I see that x1=u= -s. If I just replace u by -s, I will have both x1= -s and x3= -4u= 4s as in the \"given\" answer. MY x2 was v while the \"given\" x2 is -t-s. That would be the same if v= -t-s. In that case, my x4= u- t would become x4= (-s)-(-t-s)= -s+ t+ s= t, exactly as given.\n\n    That means that the set of points from my answer and the \"given\" answer are exactly the same! For example, If you take s= 1, t= 1 in the \"given\" answer you get x1= -1, x2= -2, x3= 4, x4= 1.\n    If you take s= -1, v= -2 (in my original form. In terms of u, v, I am taking u= -s= -1, v= -t-s= -2.) so that x= s= -1, x2= t= -2, x3=-4s= 4, x4= s-t= 1, just as before.\n\n    Because there are 2 (independent) equations in 4 unknowns, we have 4-2= 2 \"degrees of freedom\". We are free to choose any two parameters, arbitrarily, and write x1, x2, x3, x4 in terms of those two parameters. Of course, the equations you get will depend upon those arbitrary choices.\n    Last edited by a moderator: Sep 17, 2005\n  6. Sep 17, 2005 #5\n    Thanks bud, i'll look at it later on.

One is that you are rounding to the nearest mark. That introduces an uncertainty of exactly \u00b10.0625. Next is any error in the placing of the marks on the ruler. You could handle that by rounding the first uncertainty up a little, \u00b10.064, say. Third is any error in your decision of which is the nearest mark. That's the same in nature as the second error, but statistically independent.\n    Now, suppose you decide the error is \u00b10.07 and you measured the value as 30.375. It would be quite appropriate to write the answer as, say, 30.375\u00b10.070, strange though that may seem. But it would also be reasonable to compromise there, e.g. with 30.37\u00b10.08.\n\nHave something to add?\nDraft saved Draft deleted\n\nSimilar Discussions: Significant Digits Ruler -To what decimal point\n  1.
