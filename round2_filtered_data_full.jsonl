This defines an action of the group $G=\\mathbb Z/2 \\mathbb Z \\ast \\mathbb Z/2 \\mathbb Z \\ast \\mathbb Z/2 \\mathbb Z$. Indeed, just act according to existing labels or fix the element.\n\nThis action has the nice feature that it keeps invariant all counting measures on $\\mathbb Z$, i.e. all $\\mathbb Z$-Folner sequences sets are also Folner sequences for the $G$-action.\n\nNow, the space of labellings (as above) of the graph is itself a probability measure space (a Bernoulli space), which carries an ergodic p.m.p. $\\mathbb Z$-action by shifting. It is easy to see that $G$ acts on this space by measure preserving transformations (just by the method described above, done orbit by orbit) and induces an action as required. Indeed, the orbits are just the $\\mathbb Z$-orbits, so its ergodic and amenable. Faithfulness follows the fact that you considered all labellings, so that with positive probability (on the space of labellings), an element will act non-trivially. Note also that $G$ is not amenable.\n\nEDIT: As requested, more details on the action. The elements of the shift space are maps $f: \\mathbb Z \\to \\lbrace a,b,c \\rbrace$ with $f(n) \\neq f(n+1)$. A letter shifts $f$ to the right if $f(1)$ equals that letter, it shifts to the left, if $f(0)$ is equal to the letter; otherwise you fix $f$. It is obvious that the orbits are just the orbits of the shift-action of $\\mathbb Z$. Hence, the induced equivalence relation is just the one induced by the action of $\\mathbb Z$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI may miss something, but I don't see how it becomes an action. Take the sake of example the following labelling: $a$ on the edge $(0,1)$, and $b$ on all other edges $(n,n+1)$. Then, according to what you say, $a$ maps 0 to 1 and preserves all other vertices, whereas $a^{-1}$ maps 1 to 0 and preserves all other ones (I presume you meant that if you reverse orientation of an edge, then the label changes to its inverse). But then their composition is not the identity map. \u2013\u00a0 R W Mar 27 '11 at 13:37\nThanks, I corrected the construction. \u2013\u00a0 Andreas Thom Mar 27 '11 at 21:04\nI agree that now there is an action of the free product on $\\mathbb Z$. However, I still don't see how you define an action of this free product on your space of symbol sequences (your description \"just by the method described above, done orbit by orbit\" is not clear to me at all), and why this hypothetical action should be orbit equivalent to the shift. \u2013\u00a0 R W Mar 27 '11 at 22:27\nIt is really easy; I added more details above. \u2013\u00a0 Andreas Thom Mar 28 '11 at 0:15\nThat's nice - thank you. \u2013\u00a0 R W Mar 28 '11 at 3:48\n\nI believe in this paper there is an example of such group:\n\n  \u2022 Rostyslav Grigorchuk, Volodia Nekrashevych, \"Amenable actions of nonamenable groups\" (which can be downloaded from Volodia's webpage)\n\nalso, this is related (but not quite clear if one can built examples that you ask from it):\n\n  \u2022 Yair Glasner, Nicolas Monod, \"Amenable actions, free products and a fixed point property\"\nshare|improve this answer\nLet me also mention that by taking ``generic'' (think Baire category) generators one can show that the free groups have such an action. Also, by a result of Kirchberg (ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1282231), if $\\Gamma$ has property (T) and also has such an action then it must be residually finite. \u2013\u00a0 Jesse Peterson Mar 24 '11 at 12:53\n\nLet me join the discussion. Nicolas rightly says that amenability of an action is equivalent to amenability of the orbit equivalence relation and of a.e. stabilizer. It is also true that for a finite invariant measure amenability of the action is equivalent to amenability of the acting group. However, there is no contradiction here as (at least a priori) it might be possible that the orbit equivalence relation of an action of a non-amenable group is still amenable - due to the presence of huge stabilizers (which in this case must necessarily be non-amenable).\n\nI think that the paper by Grigorchuk and Nekrashevych quoted by Kate does provide a requested example. Indeed, they construct (Sections 3 and 4) a non-amenable group which has a faithful self-similar action on a homogeneous rooted tree. This action preserves the uniform measure on the boundary of the tree. Moreover, the orbit equivalence relation is a subrelation (mod 0) of the tail (or co-final in authors' terminology) equivalence relation. Since the latter one is hyperfinite ($\\equiv$ amenable), the orbit equivalence relation is also amenable.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

An extremal black hole has $|Q|=2M$ (in the appropriate units). An electron has $|q| \\gg 2m$ in the same units. If the electron fell into a negatively charged extremal R-N black hole, then the black hole would have $|Q| > 2M$, which would make it more than extremal. This would cause it to be a naked singularity, which would be exciting, since it would be a counterexample to the cosmic censorship hypothesis; but I'm pretty sure there is no such trivial counterexample, since cosmic censorship is still alive and kicking, decades after being conjectured. Another way of seeing that it will be repelled is that extremal R-N black holes with like charges do not interact; their gravitational attraction exactly cancels their electrostatic repulsion. Since the electron has a greater $|q|/m$, it will definitely be repelled.\n\nOne thing to watch out for in this kind of situation is that different observers can disagree on the direction of the forces. For example, a light ray that falls radially into a black hole experiences a repulsion at certain points as measured in Schwarzschild coordinates. This is the famous \"Hilbert repulsion\" beloved of kooks like Angelo Loinger. The light ray nevertheless passes through the horizon, and local observers never see a repulsion -- McGruder, Gravitational repulsion in the Schwarzschild field, Phys. Rev.

Suppose there is an $f\\in REC$ such that all the recursive languages are in the complexity class $\\mathcal{C}(f)=${$f_i\\in RE:\\forall x\\ \\Phi(i,x)\\leq f(x)$}.\n\nHere are two ways you can prove this is not possible:\n\n1) $\\Phi(i,x)=y$ is $REC$, thus let $N$ be the TM which computes it. We can use $N$ to construct a new TM $N'$ which takes as input $i$, then calculates $\\Phi(i,x)=y$ for every $x$ and all $y\\leq f(x)$ and it halts iff for some $x$, $\\Phi(i,x)=y$ is false for all $y\\leq f(x)$ or $rng(f_i(x))\\nsubseteq${$0,1$}.\n\nHaving a closer look on $N'$, we see that it recognizes exactly the language\n\n$TOT'=${$i\\in\\mathbb{N}:f_i\\mbox{ not total}\\vee f\\mbox{ is not a relation}$}.\n\nThus $TOT'\\in RE$ which can not be true because it is $\\Sigma_2$-complete. ($\\Sigma_2$ contains the relations which are $RE$ given a $co-RE$ oracle).\n\n2) We use the Recursive Relatedness Theorem, i.e.\n\nSuppose $\\Phi,\\Psi$ be complexity measures. Then there exists an $r(x,y)\\in REC$ s.t.:\n\n(i) $\\forall x,y\\ r(x,y)< r(x,y+1)$;\n\n(ii) $\\forall i\\ \\forall^* x\\ \\Phi(i,x)\\leq r(x,\\Psi(i,x))$; ($\\forall^*$ means for all but finitely many)\n\n(iii) $\\forall i\\ \\forall^* x\\ \\Psi(i,x)\\leq r(x,\\Phi(i,x))$.\n\n(This says roughly that the one measure is bounded by the other using a REC function.)\n\nLet $\\Phi$ be the measure under consideration and $T$ the usual masure of time complexity. By (iii), $T(i,x)\\leq r(x,\\Phi(i,x))$ and since $r$ is increasing for $y$ and $\\Phi(i,x)\\leq f(x)$, we get that $T(i,x)\\leq r(x,f(x))$ for all $i$ s.t. $f_i\\in \\mathcal{C}(f)$.\n\n$r(x,f(x))$ is recursive hence we can get a TM $M_{i_0}$ which given an input $x$ moves $r(x,f(x))+1$ times and halts with output $0$. $f_{i_0}$ realizes a recursive language so it is in $\\mathcal{C}(f)$, which means that $\\forall^* x\\ r(x,f(x))+1=T(i_0,x)\\leq r(x,f(x))$. But this is a contradiction.\n\nIf you want to see the proof that $TOT'$ is $\\Sigma_2$-complete (actually that $TOT=\\mathbb{N}\\setminus TOT'$ is $\\Pi_2$-complete. $TOT$ contains functions instead of relations but you can easily reduce the one to the other) you can check it in p.224 of Computability, complexity and languages of Martin Davis.\n\nInside the same book, you can find the proof of the recursive relatedness theorem in p.422.

Without the normality condition, I don't have a counterexample but my guess is that there is one.\n\nEDIT after Chris' and Jason's comments: in fact the proof in the case of normal algebraic spaces can be made substantially simpler than in the book (which proves a more general result about noetherian Deligne-Mumford stacks).

Cover $X$ by \u00e9tale maps $X_i\\to X$ with each $X_i$ integral and affine. There is a dense open subspace $U$ of $X$ which is a scheme and such that each induced map $U_i:=X_i\\times_X U\\to U$ is finite. Let $V\\to U$ be an \u00e9tale Galois cover, with Galois group $G$, dominating all the $U_i$'s. Now let $\\overline{V}\\to X$ (resp. $\\overline{X_i}\\to X$) be the normalization of $X$ in $V$ (resp. in $X_i$); we have dense open immersions $V\\subset \\overline{V}$ and $X_i\\subset \\overline{X_i}$. By functoriality, $G$ acts on $\\overline{V}$, with quotient $X$.\n\nI claim that $\\overline{V}$ is a scheme. Indeed, for each $i$, $\\overline{X_i}$ is also the normalization of $X$ in $U_i$. In particular there is an $X$-morphism $f_i:\\overline{V}\\to\\overline{X_i}$ (deduced from $V\\to U_i$) which must be finite surjective (everyone is integral, finite and surjective over $X$). Put $V_i:=f_i^{-1}(X_i)$: this is an open subspace of $\\overline{V}$ which is finite over $X_i$, hence an affine scheme. So, the union $W$ of the $V_i$'s is an open subspace of $\\overline{V}$ which is a scheme and maps surjectively to $X$ (since $V_i\\to X_i$ is surjective), hence $\\overline{V}$ is covered by $\\{gW\\}_{g\\in G}$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n@Chris: Are you asking Laurent to repeat the arguments from his book? \u2013\u00a0 Jason Starr Feb 7 '12 at 11:15\nadd comment\n\nOne class of counterexamples arises from quotients by actions of infinite discrete groups acting freely, but it only works under some definitions of algebraic space.

The property of such quotients that I use is that if an irreducible algebraic space $X$ of dimension at least two is the quotient of a scheme $S$ by a finite group $G$, then there is no point on $X$ with the property that every closed curve in $X$ contains that point. The reason is that given any point in $S$, it is certainly possible to find a curve in $S$ missing the $G$-orbit of that point, and thus we obtain a curve in $X$ missing any given point.\n\nOn the other hand, there are algebraic spaces with a point contained in every closed curve. A classical example is obtained as follows. Let $X'$ denote the blow up of $\\mathbb{P}^2$ at 10 points lying on a smooth plane cubic. Suppose that the points on the cubic are chosen so that the 10 divisor classes determined by them and the class of a line in the Picard group of the cubic are independent. It is a fact (proved by Artin, I believe) that a curve with negative definite self-intersection on a smooth surface can be contracted to an algebraic space. In particular, denoting by $C$ the strict transform of the cubic in $X'$, the curve $C$ can be contracted on $X'$ to an algebraic space $X$. It is also a consequence of the construction that the curve $C$ intersects every curve in $X'$, and therefore every curve in $X$ contains the point to which $C$ is contracted.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\"given any point in $S$, it is certainly possible to find a curve in $S$ missing the $G$-orbit of that point\": why is that? \u2013\u00a0 Laurent Moret-Bailly Jan 27 '12 at 10:46\n@Laurent: I was thinking $S$ of finite type over a field and a finite set of closed points.

This means $H \\leq C_G(H)$. By Lagrange's theorem, $C_G(H)$ (applied to $H \\leq C_G(H)$ and $ C_G(H) \\leq G$), this means $C_G(H)$ is either of order 7 or 203. I am not sure how to eliminate one of the cases. If I assume it is of order 203, and hence equal to $G$, immediately means that $H \\leq Z(G)$, as it commutes with all the elements of G. Using Lagrange's theorem again on $Z(G)$, you can say that $Z(G)$is either $H$ or $G$. If it is $H$, then $|G/Z(G)|$ equals 29, which implies that it is cylic, and hence G is abelian, which is a contradicts $Z(G)=H$ as $Z(G)=G$. Hence $Z(G)=G$.\n\nSo coming to the point, I want to know why $C_G(H) \\ne 7$ Thanks!\n\nshare|improve this question\nIn fact,when $G/H$ is cyclic then there is an element $\\bar{x}=xH\\in G/H$, $G/H=\\langle\\bar{x}\\rangle$ so $G=\\langle x,H\\rangle$ and so $G$ is abelian. \u2013\u00a0 B.

Normality of $H$ means that any element $x$ of $P$ acts on $H$ by conjugation, which is an automorphism of $H$. If $x$ is of order 29, then this automorphism must have an order that is a factor of 29. What do you know about the (orders of) automorphisms of $H$?\n\nEdit: Here is a solution without using Sylow theorems. Assume that $H$ is generated by an element $z$, so $H=\\{1=z^7,z,z^2,\\ldots,z^6\\}$. Let $x\\neq1$ be any other element of $G$. It was given that $H$ is a normal subgroup, so we know that $xzx^{-1}=z^j$ for some $j\\in\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Then it follows that $$ x^2zx^{-2}=x(xzx^{-1})x^{-1}=xz^jx^{-1}=z^{j^2}. $$ Here we can, of course, compute $j^2$ modulo $7$. Continuing in the same way (induction, if you wish) we get that $$ x^rzx^{-r}=z^{j^r}, $$ for all natural numbers $r$. Again we are at liberty to compute the exponent $j^r$ modulo $7$.\n\nYou probably know (Little Fermat) that if $j\\neq0$, then $j^6\\equiv1\\pmod{7}$. The idea is to combine that bit with our information about the order of $x$. Why is that important? If $\\ell=\\mathrm{ord}_G(x)$, then $x^\\ell=1$, so we must have $$ z=1\\cdot z\\cdot1=x^\\ell zx^{-\\ell}=z^{j^\\ell}. $$ This shows that we must have $j^\\ell\\equiv 1\\pmod 7.$\n\nLet's take stock. We know that $j^\\ell$ and $j^6$ are both congruent to 1 modulo 7. But $\\ell$ has to be one of $7,29,$ or $203$. Therefore $\\ell$ and $6$ have no common divisors. Therefore the order of $j$ in the group $\\mathbb{Z}_7^*$ must be a factor to $\\gcd(6,\\ell)=1$, so we can deduce that $j\\equiv 1\\pmod 7$. But wait a minute! We have just shown that $xzx^{-1}=z^j=z$. This means that $x$ commutes with $z$, hence with all powers of $z$. In other words $x\\in C_G(H)$.

Perhaps I sort strictly by the elements in the first column, perhaps I use SortBy[...] to sequentially sort by the elements in successive columns, etc. Here, regardless of what I do, the result of this sort will be some one-to-one mapping from items in $Q$ to some items in the sorted array, $Q^*$.\n\nCan I somehow retain or reuse this particular one-to-one mapping function on some other array with the same dimensions as $Q$? Very specifically, I mean that if we move element $q_i \\in Q$ at position $(a_1, a_2, ...)$ in $Q$ to some new position $(b_1, b_2, ...)$ in $Q^*$, then we corresponding move the same element $h_i \\in H$ from $(a_1, a_2, ...)$ in $H$ to $(b_1, b_2, ...)$ in $H^*$. And we do this regardless of the identity of $h_i$, i.e. we're not repeating the sort.\n\nTo provide a specific example of where I'm getting in trouble, I'd like to sort the following list by the first column, then the second (with this priority):\n\ndata = {{4, 5}, {6, 1}, {11, 87}, {24, 52}, {90, 4}, {4, 4}};\n\n In[...]:= SortBy[data, {#[[1]], #[[2]]} &]\n Out[...]:= {{4, 4}, {4, 5}, {6, 1}, {11, 87}, {24, 52}, {90, 4}}\n\n\n  In[...]:= Ordering[SortBy[data, {#[[1]], #[[2]]} &]]\n  Out[...]:= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} \n\nWhat I wanted from Ordering[...] was:\n\n  Out[...]:= {6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nHow can I make the above work?\n\nshare|improve this question\nYes you can.

As I mentioned in comments, I can see two ways to solve this.\n\nOrdering - based solution (and a by-product: compilable SortBy)\n\nOne way is to use Ordering, but the problem here is that SortBy when used with a list of functions performs in a way where each function serves as a tie-breaker for ties resulting from application of a previous function to a pair of list elements. Should we have a built-in OrderingBy function, and that would be easy. But Ordering requires a single sorting function, just like Sort.\n\nGenerating a comparison function\n\nThe solution I will use here is to generate a possibly complex single comparison function from a list of functions used in SortBy. Here is a possible code for it:\n\ngenerateSortingFunction[funcs__] :=\n     sortFGenerator[funcs] //. {\n        sortFGenerator[f_, funs___] :> \n           (With[{fst = f[#1], sec  = f[#2]},\n               If[OrderedQ[{fst, sec}],\n                  If[OrderedQ[{sec, fst}],\n               ]] &),\n        sortFGenerator[][__] :> True}\n\nAssuming that a list of functions in your example is {#[[1]]&,#[[2]]&}, we will have then:\n\nsf = generateSortingFunction[#[[1]]&,#[[2]]&]\nWith[{fst$=(#1[[1]]&)[#1],sec$=(#1[[1]]&) [#2]},\n\nThis is admittedly a mess, but the reason I decided to go with the code generation is that such generated pure functions can be compiled, which in this case can be checked by executing e.g.\n\ncf = \n   Compile[{{fst, _Integer, 1}, {sec, _Integer, 1}},\n      sf[fst, sec], \n      CompilationOptions -> {\"InlineExternalDefinitions\" -> True}\n\nTo some extent, this works around SortBy not being compilable, since Sort with this comparison function can be compiled and effectively would work as SortBy.\n\nImplementing orderingBy\n\nWith the above construct, we can now implement our own version of orderingBy, as follows:\n\norderingBy[lst_, funs_List] :=\n   Ordering[lst, All, generateSortingFunction[funs]];\n\nNow, for your example, we have:\n\n\n(* {6,1,2,3,4,5} *)\n\nUsing SortBy\n\nThe second option is to use SortBy itself, but on a more complex list where positions will be added to elements. I will use here the code from this answer, which allows to elegantly compose functions passed to SortBy. I will reproduce this here for completeness:\n\nsortFun /: SortBy[expr_, sortFun[funs_List, partFun_]] := \n   SortBy[expr, Map[Composition[#, partFun] &, funs]];\n\nwith this, the implementation ot orderingBy function is straight-forward: \"dress\" original list with element positions, reorder it by SortBy, and extract positions from reordered list:\n\norderingByAlt[lst_, funs_List] :=\n       Transpose[{#, Range[Length[#]]}] &@lst, \n       sortFun[funs, First]\n   ][[All, 2]]\n\nwhich of course gives the same result:\n\norderingByAlt[data, {#[[1]] &, #[[2]] &}]\n\n(* {6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  *)\n\n\nWhich of the two approaches to pick is largely a matter of taste. The second one seems more economical, since we reused higher-level abstraction (SortBy). However, if for example one would want to compile the code, then the first approach seems preferable, since it generates compilable code.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nUsing Szabolcs's clever inversion method we can write a more concise and efficient form than the standard decorate-and-sort:\n\norderingBy[lst_List, sfuns_List] :=\n    Range @ Length @ lst,\n    Cases[sfuns, f_ :> (f @ lst[[#]] &)]\n\n\n\n\nThis proves to be an order of magnitude faster than Leonid's orderingByAlt:\n\ndata = RandomInteger[10000, {500000, 2}];\n\norderingByAlt[data, {#[[1]] &, #[[2]] &}] // Timing // First (* Leonid's function *)\n\norderingBy[data, {#[[1]] &, #[[2]] &}]    // Timing // First (* my function *)\n\n\n\nshare|improve this answer\n+1.

Since EF >= E'F' this gives \n\n     PC*sin(C) >= E'F'   ........................................[1]\n\nAlso, we have \n\n     F'E' = F'D + DE' \n          = PF*cos(90-A) + PE*cos(90-B)\n          = PF*sin(A) + PE*sin(B)         .......................[2]\n\nThe combination of [1] and [2] shows that\n\n     PC * sin(C) >= PF*sin(A) + PE*sin(B)\n\n                        sin(A)       sin(B)\n              PC >= PF* ----- + PE * ----- \n                        sin(C)       sin(C)\n\nIn the same way you find similar results for PA and PB. These three \nexpressions combine to:\n     PA+PB+PC >=\n\n         sin(A)  sin(B)       sin(B)  sin(C)       sin(A)  sin(C)\n     PD*(----- + -----) + PE*(----- + -----) + PF*(----- + -----)\n         sin(B)  sin(A)       sin(C)  sin(B)       sin(C)  sin(A)\n\n              >= 2*(PD + PE + PF)\n\nbecause x + 1/x >= 2.\n\nAnd we have proven the Erdos-Mordell theorem (from 1935).

See S. R. Driver, Deuteronomy (ICC), 355-56. For the MT \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 (b\u00ffney yisra\u2019el, \u201csons of Israel\u201d) a Qumran fragment has \u201csons of God,\u201d while the LXX reads \u1f00\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 (angelwn qeou, \u201cangels of God\u201d), presupposing \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc (b\u00ffney \u2019el) or \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd (beney \u2019elim). \u201cSons of God\u201d is undoubtedly the original reading; the MT and LXX have each interpreted it differently. MT assumes that the expression \u201csons of God\u201d refers to Israel (cf. Hos. 1:10), while LXX has assumed that the phrase refers to the angelic heavenly assembly (Pss 29:1; 89:6; cf. as well Ps 82). The phrase is also attested in Ugaritic, where it refers to the high god El\u2019s divine assembly. According to the latter view, which is reflected in the translation, the Lord delegated jurisdiction over the nations to his angelic host (cf. Dan. 10:13-21), while reserving for himself Israel, over whom he rules directly. For a defense of the view taken here, see M. S. Heiser, \u201cDeuteronomy 32:8 and the Sons of God,\u201d BSac 158 (2001): 52-74.\n\nIn general, I would have to agree with this answer that the Hebrew (MT) text is better. In this case, the Qumran fragment reading (\u201csons of God\u201d) would fairly neatly resolve the conflict between the two texts as noted above. This is what the fragment looks like:\n\n4QDeut<sup>j</sup> showing \"Sons of God\" in Deuteronomy 32:8\n\nThe Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament notes:\n\nThe Septuagint rendering, \"according to the number of the angels of God,\" is of no critical value,\u2014in fact, is nothing more than an arbitrary interpretation founded upon the later Jewish notion of guardian angels of the different nations (Sir. 17:14), which probably originated in a misunderstanding of Deuteronomy 4:19, as compared with Daniel 10:13, Daniel 10:20-21, and Daniel 12:1.\n\nHowever, that opinion was not informed by the Qumran discovery as it was translated to English (from German) in 1892. Given a fragment that provides a path to both readings, there seems to be some value in the LXX rendering.\n\nAs for what it means, I don't think either reading stands completely clear. Moses is certainly referring to something that happened in the past. One candidate is Genesis 10 which concludes:\n\nThese are the groupings of Noah\u2019s descendants, according to their origins, by their nations; and from these the nations branched out over the earth after the Flood.\u2014Genesis 10:32 (NJPS)\n\nPerhaps Genesis 11 was also invoked:\n\nEveryone on earth had the same language and the same words. And as they migrated from the east, they came upon a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there. They said to one another, \u201cCome, let us make bricks and burn them hard.\u201d\u2014Brick served them as stone, and bitumen served them as mortar.\u2014And they said, \u201cCome, let us build us a city, and a tower with its top in the sky, to make a name for ourselves; else we shall be scattered all over the world.\u201d The Lord came down to look at the city and tower that man had built, and the Lord said, \u201cIf, as one people with one language for all, this is how they have begun to act, then nothing that they may propose to do will be out of their reach. Let us, then, go down and confound their speech there, so that they shall not understand one another\u2019s speech.\u201d Thus the Lord scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel, because there the Lord confounded the speech of the whole earth; and from there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.\u2014Genesis 11:1-9 (NJPS)\n\nIf so, \"sons of Israel\" would be a difficult reading since Israel (Jacob) wasn't even born at that point.\n\n\nThe Qumran fragment (4QDeutj) has the most likely reading of this phrase: \"sons of God\".\n\nshare|improve this answer\nInteresting.

I'm unaware of any other Hebrew manuscripts that have a different text.

{"problem": "Given a gerbe over a field k, can we always find a Galois extension k' with Galois group G such that the gerbe becomes trivial after base change to k' and the second and third cohomology groups of G with coefficients in A vanish?", "final_answer": "No", "raw_text": "Retrieved from http://mathoverflow.net/questions/128508/gluing-gerbes-over-a-spectrum-of-a-field\nTake the 2-minute tour \u00d7\n\nA theorem of Giraud says that gerbes over a scheme $X$ bounded by a sheaf of Abelian groups $A$ are classified by elements of the etale cohomology group $H^2(X,A)$. Similar statements hold in other categories (differential, topological) as well.\n\nOne of the points of view on gerbes (emphasized, for example, by Hitchin in \"Lectures on special Lagrangian manifolds\") is that a gerbe can be glued from trivial gerbes just like a vector bundle can be glued from trivial vector bundles, but the gluing data is not transition functions but A-torsors. I am trying to see if this philosophy can be applied to gerbes over a spectrum of a (perfect) field $k$. Giraud's theorem tells in this case that isomorphism classes of gerbes are in bijective correspondence with elements of the Galois cohomology group $H^2(k, A)$.\n\nLet $k'/k$ be Galois with Galois group $G$ and let $A$ be an Abelian algebraic group defined over $k$ (we use $A$ to denote the corresponding Galois module). The Hochshild-Serre spectral sequence yields the following exact sequence: $$ \\ldots \\to H^2(G,A^{G_{k'}}) \\to \\mathrm{Ker}(H^2(k,A) \\to H^2(k',A)) \\to H^1(G,H^1(k',A)) \\to H^3(G,A^{G_{k'}})\\ldots $$ where $G_{k'}$ is the absolute Galois group of $k'$. Suppose we have a gerbe over $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ k$ that trivialises after base change to $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ k'$. An element of $H^1(G,H^1(k',A))$ is the gluing data that has been mentioned above (indeed, $H^1(k',A)$ classifies $A$-torsors defined over $k'$). If also the second and third cohomology of $G$ with coeffecients in $A^{G_{k'}}$ vanished then we would have an isomorphism between two middle terms of the sequence which means that any gerbe that trivialises over $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ k'$ can be described in terms of this gluing data.\n\nI have the following question: is it true that for any gerbe over $k$ one can always find a Galois extension $k'$ with Galois group $G$ such that the gerbe trivialises after base change to $k'$ and $H^2(G,A)$ and $H^3(G,A)$ vanish?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 1 down vote accepted\n\nI don't think so. I think a gerbe bound by $A$ over the spectrum of a field $k$ gives a cohomology class $\\eta\\in H^2(k,A)$, and the gerbe trivializes over an extension $k'/k$ if and only if this cohomology class trivializes. Now take $k=\\mathbb{R}$, $A=\\mathbf{G}_{m,\\mathbb{R}}$, then $H^2(k, A)={\\rm Br}(\\mathbb{R})=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{Z}/\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $\\eta\\in{\\rm Br}(\\mathbb{R})$ be the nontrivial element (corresponding to Hamilton's quaternions). Then $\\eta$ trivializes over $\\mathbb{C}$, but not over $\\mathbb{R}$, so $k'=\\mathbb{C}$, $G={\\rm Gal}(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{R})$, and $H^2(G,A)=H^2(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{R},\\mathbf{G}_m)={\\rm Br}(\\mathbb{R})\\neq 0$, so $H^2(G,A)$ does not vanish.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nindeed, the statement I hoped for is false.

Then, $P$ has cost $aC + |P|$ in $G'$, i.e. $w'(P) = aC + |P|$.\n\nThe lemma follows directly from the definition of $w'$.\n\nCall the result of Dijkstra on $G'$ $P$, which is a shortest path in $G'$. Assume $P$ was not a shortest path with fewest edges (among all shortest paths) in $G$. This can happen in one of two ways.\n\n  1. $P$ is not a shortest path in $G$.\n    Then, there is a path $P'$ with $w(P') < w(P)$.

This contradicts that $P$ was chosen as shortest path in $G'$.\n  2. $P$ is a shortest path but there is a shortest path with fewer edges.\n    Then, there is another shortest path $P'$ -- i.e. $w(P) = w(P')$ -- with $|P'| < |P|$. This implies that $w'(P') < w'(P)$ by above lemma, which again contradicts that $P$ is a shortest path in $G'$.\n\nAs both cases have led to a contradiction, $P$ is indeed a shortest path with fewest edges in $G$.\n\nThat covers one half of the proposition. What about $a < |E|$, i.e. $a = |E| - \\varepsilon$ with $\\varepsilon \\in (0,|E|)$?\n\n  1. Actually, we also need that $a$ or all weights in $G$ are integers. Otherwise, $w(P') < w(P)$ does not cause the weights in $G'$ to be at least $|E|$ apart. This is not a restriction, though; we can always scale $w$ with a constant factor so that all weights are integer, assuming we start with rational weights.\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I haven't yet been able to come up with a proof that $a = |E|$ is the smallest $a$ for which this works.

But you asked how I would estimate it without further information, so...\n\nTo make a practical answer, let's assume that 0 is a reasonable balance for this person's account after the three week trip. Airfare and hotel costs are probably planned ahead of time, and for the purposes of this problem can be considered fixed. However, the costs of meals and other incidental expenses can vary. We don't know how many people were with him either, and a lot of these expenses are roughly proportional to the number of people, so I'm going to assume it was him and his wife. If they eat cheaply and don't have a lot of other expenses, they might manage to spend only $30 a day. At the other extreme, if they eat lavishly and spend a lot on shopping or entertainment, they might spend $200 or more per day. However, for any specific person, the variation is going to be less than this, based on that person's budget. I'm going to assume a range of possible variation of about $50 per day, considering that he's there for three weeks, and also that the extremes will have some tendency to average out. That makes a range of about $1000 of possible variation over the entire trip. If all of this was charged against his checking account, and not put on credit cards, etc., then this makes for 100000 possible different to-the-penny amounts, and a chance of about 1 in 100000 that any specific sum was the final balance in his checking account. [Not necessarily, since if the balance goes below 0, it might not get a chance to bounce back.] There is of course more likelihood of numbers in the middle of the range than ones on the outside, but we don't know where 0 falls in the range! However, given that banks tend to charge severe penalties for overdrawing your account, most people try to avoid this situation, so I will assume that a balance of 0 falls on the side of heavier spending, so it falls in a range of values that are less likely than more moderate values, and so I'll throw in a factor of 2 for that and call it a 1 in 200000 chance.\"\n\nMath Chat notes that with almost 300 million people in the country, this probably happens all the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2000, Frank Morgan."}

Assuming you have an Array that starts indexing at $1$ we have the following:\n\nThe parent of a node $i$ is given by: $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{i+1}{d}\\right\\rfloor$\n\nThe $d$ children of a parent at node $i$ are given by: $di-d+1, di-d+2,\\ldots di+1$\n\nThe height of a heap (which is slightly different than the height of a binary search tree) is a longest path from the root to a leaf. A longest path will always be from the last node in the heap to the root, but how do I calculate this longest path?\n\nMy first Idea is to setup a recurrence relation for the height of the tree:\n\n\\begin{equation} h(1) = 0\\\\ h(i) = h\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{i+1}{d}\\right\\rfloor\\right)+1 \\end{equation}\n\nThis seems overly-complicated and I feel like the answer is much more simple. Is there a better way to find the height of a $d-$ary heap?\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n2 Answers\n\nup vote 3 down vote accepted\n\nA path from the last node to the leaf would always be a longest path. This is because the last node is always at the lowest level in the heap. Now, assume the root is at level $0$. Then the number of nodes at a completely filled level $i$ would be $d^i$.\n\nLet level $k$ be the last completely filled level in the heap. So the number of nodes upto (and including) level $k$ is: $$\\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{k}d^i = \\frac{d^{k+1} - 1}{d - 1}$$\n\nNow, the last node - the $n^{th}$ node - can either be the last node at level $k$, or it can be in an incomplete level $k+1$. Taking care of these two cases, it can be seen that: $$\\frac{d^{k+1} - 1}{d - 1} \\le n < \\frac{d^{k+2} - 1}{d - 1}$$ $$\\Rightarrow k\\le \\log_d(n(d-1) + 1) - 1 < k+1$$\n\nNow, equality is only if the last node is the last leaf of level $k$, which also has distance $k$ from the root. If not, that is if there is a level $k+1$, then the $\\log$ term would not be an integer, and applying the ceiling operator would give the right height of $k+1$. Thus, if the last element of the array is at position $n$, the height of the heap is: $$h = \\lceil \\log_d(nd - n + 1) \\rceil - 1$$ You can change the base of the logarithm using the change of base formula. Note that this is the same method that Yuval gives in his answer.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nA different approach is to calculate the number of points $n_d(h)$ in a saturated (maximal) $d$-ary heap of height $h$. Given $n_d(h)$, the height of a $d$-ary heap of size $n$ is the minimal $h$ such that $n_d(h) \\geq n$.

Let $G$ be an $n \\times n$ bipartite graph. Define $G'$ to be equivalent to $G$, if $G'$ can be obtained from $G$ by complementing the neighbourhoods of some vertices in $[n_r]$.

For any $n \\times n$ bipartite graph $G$, at most $2^n-n$ members of $[G]$ have a perfect matching.\n\nProof. For each $i \\in [n]_c$ there is a graph $G^i \\in [G]$ such that $i \\in [n_c]$ has degree 0 in $G^i$. Just pick the vertices in $[n]_r$ that are adjacent to $i$ in $G$ and complement their neighbourhoods. If all $G^i$ are distinct, then the lemma clearly follows. Otherwise, $G^i=G^j$ for some $i \\neq j$. Thus, both $i$ and $j$ have degree 0 in $G^i$. But now, the $n$ graphs obtained from $G^i$ by performing a single complementation each do not have a perfect matching.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThis seems to have a slight problem with the case of the configurations with exactly one zero. \u2013\u00a0 damiano Aug 9 '10 at 12:20\nNot with $n=3$ you can't :-) \u2013\u00a0 Robin Chapman Aug 9 '10 at 12:23\nI suppose that I cannot generate diagonals that have exactly $n-1$ ones in this way, since if I fix $n-1$ rows, then I automatically fix the last one.

So let us iterate over all the $n$ possibilities for $m$. Now if an $m$ is fixed, then the problem reduces to the Maximum subarray problem, and the Minimum subarray problem. This is because for the absolute difference to be the largest, one side of $m$ should have the maximum possible subarray, and the other side should have the minimum possible subarray. So we try both of these options and take the maximum absolute difference among the two.\n\nBut this is still $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, because there are $n$ different values of $m$, and for each of those values, we have to spend $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time to compute the needed minimum and maximum subarrays.\n\nThe next observation is to note that a single $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ run of the Maximum subarray algorithm on the entire array can actually give us one of the needed values for all values of $m$:\n\nGiven: int A[n]\n\nMaxSubarrayTill[0] = A[0]\nMaxSubarrayEndingAt[0] = A[0]\n    MaxSubarrayEndingAt[i] = max{A[i], MaxSubarrayEndingAt[i - 1] + A[i]}\n    MaxSubarrayTill[i] = max{MaxSubarrayTill[i - 1], MaxSubarrayEndingAt[i]}\n\nHere, $\\text{MaxSubarrayTill}[i]$ denotes the maximum sum subarray which ends $\\le i$, and $\\text{MaxSubarrayEndingAt}[i]$ denotes the maximum sum subarray which ends at index $i$.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the $\\text{MinSubarrayTill}[i]$ array in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. And by repeating the same two algorithms in reverse (ie. from the end of the array to the beginning), we can get $\\text{MaxSubarrayFrom}[i]$ and $\\text{MinSubarrayFrom}[i]$.\n\nSo in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time we have precomputed all the values that we needed in the first algorithm, which we can now go back to. Interate over all the values of $m$, and find the largest absolute difference in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time.\n\nIf the problem also stipulates that the two subarrays should be adjacent, then we can leave out $\\text{MaxSubarrayTill}[i]$ and its analogous arrays, and instead only consider $\\text{MaxSubarrayEndingAt}[i]$ and its analogous three other arrays. The rest of the algorthm remains the same.\n\n| cite | improve this answer | |\n\nYour Answer"}
{"problem": "Suppose you're a contestant on a game show with three doors, behind one of which is a car and behind the other two are goats. You choose one door, but before it's opened, the game show host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat. Should you stick with your original choice or switch to the other unopened door to increase your chances of winning the car?", "final_answer": "Switch doors", "raw_text": "Retrieved from https://wonderfulengineering.com/this-math-problem-had-stumped-thousands-of-experts-over-the-years/amp/\nWonderful Engineering\n\nThis Math Problem Had Stumped Thousands Of Experts Over The Years\n\nYou might hate math and the problems that it brings with it. However, there are certain problems that make people think about the possible solution and they can\u2019t find one. This one problem, called the Monty Hall problem, had stumped thousands of people around the world including math professors and statisticians. None of them was able to solve it so far. The person who came up with the problem is Zachary Crockett. He is a writer for Priceconomics. Zachary and his girlfriend were the first one to find the problem.\n\nHe said that he and his girlfriend debated on the problem for more than 2 hours but still couldn\u2019t find an appropriate solution. The problem is known as Monty Hall Problem. It is named after the game show host who made it famous. The problem is like this. Let\u2019s say there are three doors. There is a car behind one of the three doors. Behind the other door are 2 goats.\n\nYou are asked to pick one door. Then Monty shows you the goats behind one of the doors, that you didn\u2019t choose. Now comes the situation where you are allowed to change your answer to the other door that you didn\u2019t choose or stick with your original choice. Which one do you choose? Zachary said that he got interested in the problem and did a little research too to find the answer. Then he found out that there is another angle to the story.\n\nIn 1988, Merilyn\u00a0Von Savant was interviewed by Joe Franklyn. She is one of those people who has the world\u2019s highest IQ. She started writing for a magazine and that\u2019s where she got a mail from someone asking about the Monty Hall problem. When it comes to people like us, the ordinary ones, we would like to stick to our original answer of the door. However, Merilyn replied, \u201cYes. You should switch.\u201d Here\u2019s why she said so. There are three doors, with a car behind one and goats behind the two. You are more likely to pick a goat than a car since the ratio here is 2/3.\n\nWhen you pick door one, Monty Hall is supposed to reveal one goat regardless of what you picked. In another scenario, you might have also picked the door who has a goat behind it. Here\u2019s when Monty asks, whether you want to keep the door you picked or you want to switch? You should most definitely switch when this question arises. If you do, there are chances that you get the car 2/3rds of the time. When Merilyn answered that question, she received thousands of letter from all over the world telling her that she was totally wrong. She was also surprised at the response. Even though her answer was right, sexism was playing its part to prove her wrong.\n\nThe Monty Hall problem was published in 1975 for the first time. A guy named Steve Selvin at Berkeley gave the problem to The American Statistician. Selvin said that you should switch and everyone believed him. In the next 15 years, many other academics repeated the same problem and no one ever told them they are wrong. Then in 1990, Merilyn answered the same question and people lost their mind. She calculated and find out that from the 10,000 response that she got after the answer, only 8% of the readers actually agreed with her. After writing some more columns about it, She was only able to raise it to 56%. Among the academics, only 35% were initially supporting the answer and the percentage rose to 70 later on. The only way she made people agree with her was by asking them to do the experiment themselves. A number of teachers of elementary, middle and high school responded that their students were able to prove her answer right.\n\nSomething about this problem really strikes chords with not only statisticians but with daily life problems as well."}

I've got a counter I only increment if the current cell is on the same line with the previously examined one and reset it otherwise.

(note again that we haven't visited $a[1][j+1]$ yet).\n\nNow if we calculate our subproblems starting from $j = n$ towards $j=1$ for every value of $m$, you shall have your answer in $C(1, \\ 1, \\ k)$.\n\nI shall leave the base cases and runtime analysis to you.

How much heat has been added to the river by the change in gravitational potential energy in the rivet-Earth system? Also, the river absorbs the heat of the rivet with virtually no temperature change (it's large enough to serve as a \"heat reservoir\"), so what is the change in the entropy of the river from that?\n\n    So there is the entropy change of the cooling rivet plus the entropy change from the change in mechanical energy plus the entropy change from the heat transfer from rivet to river.\n  4. Aug 14, 2011 #3\n    Thanks for the reply.\n\n    So, as I see it, so far I've worked out the decrease in the entropy of the rivet.\n\n    The heat flowing into the reservoir from the rivet cooling will be the same as the heat loss from the rivet:\n\n\n    That gives me 17250 J.\n\n    Then, if we assume the temperature of the reservoir doesn't change, then, using the temperature of the river in Kelvins for T:\n\n\n    That gives me an increase of entropy in the river as 62.1 JK-1\n\n    Finally, the change in gravitational potential energy is:\n\n\n    If we assume that this is all converted to heat in the river we can work out a second component for the increase in entropy. I get S = 0.13 JK-1.\n\n    Overall this gives me a net increase in the entropy of the universe as S = 21.93 JK-1.\n\n    Is this the right track or have I completely messed up?\n  5. Aug 14, 2011 #4\n\n\n    User Avatar\n    Homework Helper\n\n    I agree with those results to the first decimal place (since I rounded off only at the end), so we get a net increase in entropy for the \"universe\" of 21.9 J/K .\n\n    It is a reasonable safe assumption that just about all of the potential energy change is transferred into heating the river. The \"splash\" at impact displaces water and ejects some of it upward (briefly), as well as producing (a minute amount of) acoustical energy. But since practically all the water falls back into the river, that mechanical energy winds up heating the river after all. (We can extend \"the universe\" to include the air over the river, but the tiny amounts of water scattered as microdroplets and vapor and of sound energy probably contribute additions to entropy scarcely worth pursuing...)\n\nSimilar Discussions: Entropy change of a hot, falling object\n  1.

It is a fair question, though. Even with class number one, we can begin with $1 + 3 = 4,$ although $x^2 + 3 y^2$ does not represent $2.$ The way Dickson would have talked about this is the imprimitive form of the same discriminant, namely $2 x^2 + 2 x y + 2 y^2.$\n\nStaying with one class per genus, we have $1 + 5 = 6,$ although $x^2 + 5 y^2$ does not represent $2,3.$ This is a different phenomenon called Gauss composition. The trick for this one is that $2 x^2 + 3 y^2$ does represent $2,3,$ and there is a different identity that allows $(2 a^2 + 3 b^2)(2 c^2 + 3 d^2) = x^2 + 6 y^2. $ You should probably be able to find such an identity by hand.\n\nOne of the simplest ones where identifying the primes involved becomes a mess is $x^2 + 11 y^2.$ It is a bit of a problem (although solved) to say which primes can be expressed as $x^2 + 11 y^2$ and which by $3 x^2 + 2 x y + 4 y^2,$ among those primes $p$ for which the Jacobi symbol $(-11 | p) = 1.$ But, seeing as the latter form does represent $3,5$ integrally, we are not surprised to see $4 + 11 = 15.$ In this case, you ought to involve the \"opposite\" form in $(3 a^2 + 2 a b + 4 b^2)(3 c^2 - 2 c d + 4 d^2) = x^2 + 11 y^2.$ The presence of the opposite form is what makes the set (of three \"classes\") into a group.\n\nWell, that's a start.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI'm not sure this speaks to the question which, as I understand it, goes: if $z=pq$, and $p=a^2+nb^2$, and $q=c^2+nd^2$, then must every representation $z=e^2+nf^2$ come from these representations of $p$ and $q$?

Is there a scheme such that we can encrypt the message $m$ using the $n$ public keys and produce a encrypted message $E(m)$ such that only the $n$ intended recipients can decipher the message $m$?\n\nOne method could be to encrypt the message $n$ times, using each recipients public key, and append them all. That is, if $e_i$ is the encrypted message $m$ using the public key $p_i$, then the encrypted message sent to all the recipients could be $E(m) = p_1|e_1|p_2|e_2 \\dots p_n|e_n$, where $|$ is the concatenation operation. But this will increase the size of the encrypted message by $O(n)$. So my question really is \u2013 can we keep the message length manageable and simultaneously allow multiple recipients to securely decrypt the message.\n\nIs there a special name given to this kind of cryptography problem? The problem seems natural and perhaps has been investigated. I will be grateful for pointers to literature in this area.\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nup vote 12 down vote accepted\n\nThis problem is often called broadcast encryption: how can you set up a system that will enable transmission of an encrypted message to an arbitrarily chosen subset of the people involved? There's a trade-off between two difficulties. If you just give each user an individual key in a generic public key cryptosystem, without setting up some sort of special system, then there's nothing you can do except to append all the encryptions, which is a problem if the number of users is huge. (Imagine broadcasting an event to a billion subscribers. Adrien's observation is an important point, but it doesn't change the scaling.) In the other extreme, you could assign a different key to each subset you might ever want to broadcast to. This works fine if you care only about a few subsets, but if you want a lot of flexibility then you get too many keys for the users to keep track of. It turns out that there are nontrivial solutions to this problem. The original paper is by Fiat and Naor (in Crypto '93), and searching for \"broadcast encryption\" online will give tons of follow-up papers offering extensions and improvements.\n\nYou might also be interested in \"attribute-based encryption\", in which each user is associated with a list of different attributes and you can encrypt messages so they can be decrypted by just the users with desired combinations of attributes. This is a somewhat different approach, but it has some beautiful consequences. The original paper is by Sahai and Waters (Eurocrypt 2005), and again there have been many further papers.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThank you for your answer. It answers my question, but I am curious about one thing. You say that \"If you just give each user an individual key in a generic public key cryptosystem, without setting up some sort of special system, then there's nothing you can do except to append all the encryptions\" Des it mean that it is an open problem to construct a better scheme or is it a proven result that it is impossible to construct some such system? \u2013\u00a0 Balaji Apr 18 '11 at 16:17\nHmm, I should have thought a little harder. I'm almost sure it is true, and it ought to be provable, but it depends on how you formulate it. Given black-box access to a public key cryptosystem, you could ask whether there's any way to come up with a shorter string than the concatenated encryptions, such that each recipient could recover the message, and such that if anyone else could break this system, it would break the original public key cryptosystem. I think you should be able to prove this is impossible, but it would be foolish to be too certain without actually proving it. \u2013\u00a0 Henry Cohn Apr 18 '11 at 16:56\nIn any case, I don't know of a reference offhand. It seems like something that must have been thought about before. Maybe it is in the literature somewhere, maybe it is not published because it can be done by pretty standard techniques, maybe it is harder than I expect, and maybe I am just wrong about whether it is possible. \u2013\u00a0 Henry Cohn Apr 18 '11 at 16:58\n\nThis is an interesting question. But it seems to me that in practical cases, you don't encrypt the whole message with the public key of the recipient. Usually, you encrypt it with a fast symmetric algorithm (eg AES) using a random key $K$, and encrypt $K$ with the public key.\n\nThe size of $K$ is clearly negligible compared to the size of the message. Hence, if you have to send the same message to several recipients, you just have to encrypt $K$ several time and to append the result to the encrypted message, which doesn't increase its size too much.\n\nAnother advantage of this method is that if you want to add a new recipient, you don't have to encrypt the whole message again. Just encrypt $K$ with the public key of your new friend and append the result to the old message.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nFrom the practical point of view, I agree that it solves the problem. You can even create a new private/public key, send it encrypted once to each of your friends, and from now on you will have a new key for the \"group\" that you can use how many times you want with the cost of a single encryption. From the theoretical point of view, it is still interesting if you don't trust symmetric encryption, which as far as I know, for the available fast algorithms, never proven to be equivalent to a known hard problem (such as factorization or discrete logarithm). \u2013\u00a0 KotelKanim Apr 18 '11 at 11:12\nI don't think that factorization or discrete logarithm are known to be hard. \u2013\u00a0 Laurent Berger Apr 18 '11 at 11:23\nIndeed they aren't known to be hard. In fact, from my perspective the comparison between public and private key crypto goes the other way: people should be much more suspicious of public key crypto. It's based on the miracle that there are a handful of useful number-theoretic constructions, and all of them have subtle structure that may very plausibly allow much better attacks than what's currently known. (I'd be very surprised if the number field sieve is the best possible factoring algorithm.) By contrast, building secure private-key ciphers appears to be much more doable. \u2013\u00a0 Henry Cohn Apr 18 '11 at 12:34\nSo it's true that private-key ciphers aren't (in practice) backed up with reductions to other hard problems, but the evidence that we can build secure ciphers is arguably more compelling than the evidence that any of the hard problems used in public key cryptography is actually hard. \u2013\u00a0 Henry Cohn Apr 18 '11 at 12:41\nBut the size of the message still grows as $O(n)$. \u2013\u00a0 Nate Eldredge Nov 12 '11 at 21:10\n\nYour Answer"}

Are $\\langle ST\\rangle$ and $\\langle TS\\rangle$ always conjugated?\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n1 Answer\n\nYes, $\\langle ST \\rangle^s = \\langle TS \\rangle$ for any $s \\in S$.\n\nProof: Consider $(s_i t_j)^s = s^{-1} s_i t_j s = s^{-1} t^{-1} t s_i t_j s = (ts)^{-1} (ts_i) (t_js) \\in \\langle TS \\rangle$ where t is any element of T. Similarly, $(t_i s_j)^{s^{-1}} = s t_i s_j s^{-1} = s t_i s_j t t^{-1} s^{-1} = (st_i) (s_jt) (st)^{-1} \\in \\langle ST\\rangle$. The first sentence shows $\\langle ST \\rangle ^s \\leq \\langle TS \\rangle$ and the second shows $\\langle ST\\rangle^s \\geq \\langle TS\\rangle$, so we are done. $\\square$\n\nIn case you are curious, here is how I proceeded:\n\nI think you know already that $\\langle ST \\rangle$ and $\\langle TS \\rangle$ need not be equal, since $st$ need not be a power of $ts$, for instance taking $s=(1,2)$ and $t=(1,2,3)$. Of course, st and ts are conjugate individually, by either s or t. In particular, if either S or T has one element, then ST and TS are conjugate.\n\nA quick check of the smallest non-abelian group shows that ST and TS need not be conjugate in general: take S = { 1, (1,2) } and T = { (1,2,3), (2,3) } and then ST and TS are not even the same size. In this case the subgroups generated by ST and TS are still the same, so we have to try a little harder.\n\nWe can use a sort of universal construction for the counterexample. If we don't want the subgroups generated by ST and TS to be conjugate, we might as well make G minimal with respect to containing S and T, that is $G = \\langle S \\cup T \\rangle$. We also don't want things to be conjugate that don't have to be, so we don't want G to have any extra relations: G should be the free group on ST. Now we just need to solve a subgroup conjugacy problem in a free group.\n\nI didn't know how to do this, so I checked finite quotients of the free group (code available on request), and discovered there were no counterexamples of small order or nilpotency class. I then began to suspect I either needed a very complicated counterexample, or that it might even be true.\n\nUsing the GAP package called FGA by Christian Sievers, one sees that this also holds if |S| \u2264 |T| \u2264 100. In fact, one can always take the conjugating element to be an arbitrary element of S. For example, |S| = |T| = 2 is handled with the following code:\n\ngap> m := 2;; n := 2;;\ngap> f := FreeGroup( m + n );;\ngap> s := GeneratorsOfGroup( f ){[ 1 .. m ]};;\ngap> t := GeneratorsOfGroup( f ){[ m + 1 .. m + n ]};;\ngap> st := Subgroup( f, ListX( s, t, \\* ) );;\ngap> ts := Subgroup( f, ListX( t, s, \\* ) );;\ngap> IsConjugate( f, st, ts );\ngap> st^f.1 = ts;\n\nObviously, one conjectures this always holds, and in fact the proof was an easy calculation (at the top of the answer).\n\nshare|improve this answer\nHey Jack, what a GREAT answer and solution!

It is:\n\n   a^2*y0*y + b^2*x*x0 = a^2*b^2\n\nAssuming (x0,y0) is in the first quadrant, the slope of this line is\n-b^2*x0/(a^2*y0). The slope of the line K perpendicular to this line is \nthe negative reciprocal of this, namely, a^2*y0/(b^2*x0).

Remember that x^12 is an even function, and note that 2^x approaches 0 as x approaches -infinity, but also remember that when x=0 that x^12 = 0, so you know that the two plots cross once for x < 0. You might guess they cross once for x>=0, but think about when x is > say 1000 and when x is say 2. Which function is larger in each case? Which is larger at x=0? Which is larger for x = -1000?\n  4.

Since that fraction itself becomes \"infinity over infinity\" we can apply L'Hopital's rule. Repeatedly differentiating, the numerator just stays 2x (times a power of ln(2)) while the denominator has lower and lower powers eventually becoming a constant (after 12 differentiations, we get 12!) and then 0. What does that tell you about the limit? And what does that tell you about whether 2x or x12 is larger for very large x?\n  5. Oct 18, 2008 #4\n    Thanks! This makes sense. So...\n\n\n    Which means that for very large x, 2^x does eventually exceed x^12, which gives us the third intersection point.\n\n    So, one last question -\n\n    Is this a good general strategy for this type of problem (if I were to get a similar one on the actual exam): First sketch the graph and see what obvious/immediate intersection points I can find. Then use the limit idea for [tex]x\\rightarrow\\infty[/tex] and [tex]x\\rightarrow-\\infty[/tex].\n\n    Will this ensure that I find all of my intersection points?\n\n    Thanks so much! :)\n  6.

For example, it there were 3 more intersections between x= 2 and infinity, the same changes in which is smaller and which is larger would be true. You might try looking at the derivative of f- g.

Instead of (n^p-n)/p \nbeing an integer, or n^p-n divisible by p, we will write:\n\n     n^p == n (mod p)\n\nwhich is read as \"n^p is congruent to n modulo p.\" It means that n^p \nand n differ by a multiple of p. So, for example, 2 == 27 (mod 5) and \n275 == 0 (mod 5).\n\nThere are some interesting properties of this modular arithmetic:\n\nIf a == b (mod m) and c == d (mod m), then also\n\n     a + c == b + d (mod m)\n     a - c == b - d (mod m)\n     a * c == b * d (mod m)\n\nDivision is a bit more difficult:\n\nIf the GCD of t and m is 1, and if ta == tb (mod m), then \na == b (mod m).\n\nNow on to prove Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n     n^p == n (mod p)\n\nIf n is divisible by p, then it is clearly true.\n\nIf n is not divisible by p, then the GCD of n and p is 1.\n\nWe note that for such n there are the following possibilities:\n\n     n == 1 (mod p)\n     n == 2 (mod p)\n     n == p-1 (mod p)\n\nAll numbers == 1 (mod p) are said to be in the \"residue class of 1 \nmodulo p.\"\n\nSo the numbers 1, 2, ... , p-1 represent all but one (the == 0 residue \nclass) residue classes modulo p. These p-1 residue classes are exactly \nthe residue classes representing numbers with a GCD of 1 with p.\n\nNow if we multiply all these representatives of these p-1 residue \nclasses by n, we get n*1, n*2, ... , n*(p-1). No two of these numbers \ncan be in the same residue class modulo p, because if n*x == n*y (mod \np) then x == y (mod p) (see above). But then these numbers n*1, n*2, \n..., n*(p-1) again represent all p-1 residue classes. Multiplying, we \n\n     n*1 * n*2 * ... * n*(p-1) == 1 * 2 * ... * (p-1) (mod p)\n\nDivide by 1*2*...*(p-1), which has a GCD of 1 with p, to get:\n\n     n^(p-1) == 1 (mod p)\n\nand then multiply both sides by n and we have:\n\n     n^p == n (mod p)\n\nas desired.\n\nIf you need more help, just write back.\n\nBest regards,\n- Doctor Floor, The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nCollege Number Theory\nHigh School Number Theory\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM"}

And he noted a curious fact: that certain power laws seemed to crop up in many different contexts to explain distributions of wealth.\n\nIn this step we look at how Pareto distributions follow a power law, but this time with a negative exponent, and how these shed light on wealth distributions in the modern world.\n\nThe 80-20 rule\n\nThere is an old rule in economics, that the top \\(\\normalsize{20\\%}\\) own \\(\\normalsize{80\\%}\\) of everything. And of that top \\(\\normalsize{20\\%}\\), the top \\(\\normalsize{20\\%}\\) of them own \\(\\normalsize{80\\%}\\) of the \\(\\normalsize{80\\%}\\). And so on. Economists refer to such a distribution as scale-free.\n\nQ1 (E): What percentage does the top \\(\\normalsize 20\\%\\) of the top \\(20\\%\\) represent? How much would they own by the \\(\\normalsize 80\\)-\\(\\normalsize 20\\) rule?\n\nThis kind of rule of course needs to be taken with a bit of latitude. It is not always rigidly \\(\\normalsize{80/20}\\). Over time a given society may become more \u201ctop heavy\u201d and then less so. For example in the US, the 1920\u2019s were a time of considerable income disparity, but then that reduced gradually, and then started to increase again in the 1970\u2019s, and is now roughly back at similar levels to the 1920s.\n\nNevertheless, it seems generally to apply to quite a lot of things. In stores, \\(\\normalsize{20\\%}\\) of customers account for \\(\\normalsize{80\\%}\\) of sales. On the internet, \\(\\normalsize{20\\%}\\) of sites get around \\(\\normalsize{80\\%}\\) of the traffic.\n\nPareto\u2019s observation\n\nPareto realized that behind the \\(\\normalsize{80/20}\\) rule was a particular distribution: in fact a power law, but now with a negative exponent.\n\ngraphs of x^n for n=-1,-2,-3 with the curve starting at x=1 to x=8 , and y from 0 to 1\n\nLet\u2019s consider a general Pareto-type curve of the form\n\n\nfor some exponent \\(\\normalsize{\\alpha}\\) usually greater than \\(\\normalsize{1}\\). The case of \\(\\normalsize{\\alpha=1}\\) is rather a special case due to the unique properties of the inverse relation \\(\\normalsize{y=1/x}\\).\n\nNow how does these abstract mathematical curves relate to real-world economics? Pareto proposed that the number \\(\\normalsize N\\) of people that had an income bigger than \\(\\normalsize x\\) satisfied a Pareto type distribution:\n\n\\[\\Large {N=\\frac{A}{x^{\\alpha}}}\\]\n\nfor some constants \\(\\normalsize A\\) and \\(\\normalsize \\alpha\\).\n\nThe \\(\\normalsize 1 \\%\\) rule of internet content creation\n\nOther manifestations of this kind of phenomenon abound. For example, a related internet rule of thumb is that only \\(\\normalsize 1 \\%\\) of internet users on a channel will create content. A variant of this is the 90\u20139\u20131 version of the rule, which states that for websites where users can both create and edit content, 1% of people create content, 9% edit or modify that content, and 90% view the content without contributing.\n\n\nWhat do you think about the relevance of such rough laws for FutureLearn courses? And perhaps more delicate, but also more interesting: how does income distribution work in your country? Is it an 80 /20 rule? Or something else?\n\n\nA1. The top \\(\\normalsize 20 \\%\\) of the top \\(\\normalsize 20 \\%\\) is the top \\(\\normalsize 4 \\%\\) of everyone. They will, assuming the 80-20 rule, own \\(\\normalsize 80 \\%\\) of \\(\\normalsize 80 \\%\\) of everything, which is \\(\\normalsize 64 \\%\\) of everything.

There are various ways to do this. One way is to recall that the relevant binomial has mean $np$ and variance $np(1-p)$. But the variance of $X$ is $E(X^2)-(E(X))^2. So E(X^2)=np(1-p) +n^2p^2$.\n\nThere are various other ways to find $E(X^2)$.\n\nSo we are maximizing $59.5n-25-200np(1-p)-200n^2p^2$, which in this case is $-(0.5n^2 -50n +25)$.\n\nFor the maximization, complete the square, or use calculus.\n\nThe answer does turn out to be exactly $50$.\n\nRemark: You asked why your answer was wrong. One way was uninteresting. You differentiated $59.5n-0.5n^2$ and got $59.5-n^2$ instead of the correct $59.5-n$.\n\nThat would have given an answer of $59.5$, say $60$-ish.\n\nThe actual answer is less, and for an interesting reason. The penalty for bad radios is $200X^2$. This is quite sensitive to large values of $X$. Roughly speaking that explains why the optimal number of radios is smaller than the $59.5$ given by your method.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

This follows from the following claims (which I will prove below):\n\n1. If $P$ is perfect and $P(0)\\ne 0$ or $P(1)\\ne 0$ then $P$ is a square.\n\n2. A perfect polynomial which is a square has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nAssume that $P$ and $P+1$ are both perfect. From Claim 1, either $P=Q^2$ is a square, or $P+1$ is a square. Consequently they are both squares (since $Q^2+1=(Q+1)^2$). From Claim 2 we get that $P$ and $P+1$ have no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_2$, which is clearly absurd.\n\nProof of Claim 1. Let $P=P_1^{a_1}\\ldots P_n^{a_n}$ be the prime decomposition of $P$ and assume that $P(0)=1$. Then $P_i(0)=1$. Since $P$ is perfect one has $$(*)\\qquad\\qquad P=\\prod_{i=1}^n(1+P_i+\\ldots + P_i^{a_i}),$$ so $1=P(0)=\\prod_{i=1}^n(1+a_i)$, proving that $a_i$ are all even. If $P(1)=1$, apply the previous argument to $P(X+1)$.\n\nProof of Claim 2. The hypothesis implies that (*) holds and all $a_i$ are even. Then $1+P_i(0)+\\ldots + P_i^{a_i}(0)=1$ for all $i$, so $P(0)=1$. The proof that $P(1)=1$ is similar.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n@Andrei: It is also a perfect solution ! \u2013\u00a0 Luis H Gallardo Jan 20 '11 at 15:47\nThank you, I enjoyed this problem! \u2013\u00a0 Andrei Moroianu Jan 20 '11 at 22:08\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

This is an interesting question which would be approached in different ways depending on the context in which it arrives (e.g., level of a course). For example, the curves could be assumed to be smooth or merely rectifiable. They could be assumed to be graphs, or not. The attainment of minimal length could be taken for granted, or require a proof. All this makes it hard to pitch the answer at the right level, and I'm most likely going to fail at that. Indeed, I do not see how one would get a solution in the form of a series, because in general the minimizer is not analytic. If this problem comes from a textbook, it would be helpful to have a reference so that an answer can be given within the context of that book.\n\nIf the existence and differentiability of a minimizing curve can be granted, then there is a variational argument to show it must have the same curvature at all points where it does not meet the constraint (i.e, does not lie on the vertical or horizontal axis). Indeed, write the curve in vector form $\\gamma(t)$, parametrized by arclength, and consider the perturbation $$\\Gamma(t)=\\gamma(t)+\\epsilon \\eta(t) R\\gamma'(t)$$ where $\\epsilon$ is a parameter, $\\eta$ is a smooth function with compact support, and $R$ denotes rotation by $\\pi/2$ clockwise. Note that $(Ru)\\times v =u\\cdot v$ and $u\\times Rv=-u\\cdot v$. The area bounded by $\\Gamma$ is expressed as an integral of $\\Gamma\\times \\Gamma'$, in which the linear term in $\\epsilon $ simplifies to $$2\\epsilon \\eta \\gamma'\\cdot \\gamma' - \\epsilon (\\eta \\gamma\\cdot \\gamma')' $$ Here the first term yields $2\\epsilon \\int \\eta$ and the second integrates to zero. Thus, we should have $\\int \\eta=0$ to preserve the area up to $O(\\epsilon^2)$.\n\nThe length of $\\Gamma$ is given by the integral of $|\\Gamma'(t)| = (\\Gamma'(t)\\cdot \\Gamma'(t))^{1/2}$ in which the linear term simplifies to\n$$ \\epsilon \\eta (\\gamma' \\cdot R\\gamma'') = \\epsilon \\eta \\kappa $$ where $\\kappa$ is the curvature of $\\gamma$. The conclusion is that $\\int \\eta \\kappa =0$ for any $\\eta$ such that $\\int \\eta =0$. Equivalently, $\\kappa$ is constant.\n\nThus, the minimizing curve will be a circular arc as long as it is free to move; i.e., as long as it does not hit the obstacle (vertical or horizontal axes). And the obstacle does get involved when $A$ is so small that no circular arc through $(0,a)$ and $(1,0)$ can bound area $A$ and stay within the first quadrant. When the obstacle takes effect, the minimizing curve consists of parts of the vertical and/or horizontal axes joined by a circular arc that is tangent to them. An obstacle must always be met tangentially: otherwise the point of contact could slide along the obstacle, decreasing length. This takes a separate perturbation argument, into which I will not go.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

Boyanov) Newsgroups: sci.math Subject: Volume of a tetrahedron Date: 27 Mar 1995 00:30:42 GMT Hi, I have a stupid question that I cannot solve myself and cannot find the answer to in any of the math handbooks I've looked at. Is there a general formula for the volume of an ARBITRARY polyhedron? I know everything there is to know about the polyhedron - the coordinates of the vertices, the equations of the planes that form the walls, the number of walls, the number of sides, the number of vertices, etc. About the only restriction that is put on the polyherdon is that it is \"convex\", i.e. all vertices lie in a single \"half-space\" relative to any wall. I was trying to do it by breaking up the polyhedron into a collection of tetrahedra and summing up the volumes of the tetrahedra, but I can't seem to come up with an algorithm that allows me to determine which vertices form the tetrahedra that make up the polyhedron. Any ideas? Is there a better nad easier way to do this? Please Cc: me if you post a followup, if at all possible. Thanks! Boyan -- Boyan I. Boyanov ============================================================================== From: (Dave Rusin) Newsgroups: sci.math Subject: Re: Volume of a tetrahedron Date: 27 Mar 1995 22:52:56 GMT In article <3l50vi$>, Boyan I. Boyanov wrote: >Is there a general formula for the volume of an ARBITRARY polyhedron? Well, I suppose I ought to answer this since I just advertised Green's theorem for a similar purpose. In this question, the author wants a space integral integral_P 1 dxdydz where P is the polyhedron. The corresponding technique is to use Stokes' Theorem, whose general form _ _ _/ w = _/ dw boundary(S) S (for w any differential form on S) specializes for 2-forms to _ _ _/ P dxdy + Q dydz + R dzdx = _/ (dP/dz + dQ/dx + dR/dy) dxdydz so we can get the space integral of 1, for example, by integrating the 2-form z dxdy over the surface of the polyhedron. We can compute the surface integrals face-by-face. The quick answer here is that the individual surface integrals, when divided by the area of the face, would compute the average value of the z coordinate on the face. Therefore, we can compute the surface integrals easily by averaging the z coordinates of the vertices of the face, and multiplying by an area: the surface integral int( zdxdy ) over a face spanned by (x0 y0 z0), (x1 y1 z1), and (x2 y2 z2) is (z0+z1+z2)/3 . | (1/2)( y1.(x0-x2) + y2.(x1-x0) + y0.(x2-x1) ) | This surface integral is added to the total if the three points are in counterclockwise order as seen from the outside of the polyhedron, subtracted otherwise. A proof is appended as a postscript to this post; it may perhaps reinforce an understanding of surface integrals. It perhaps bears mentioning that this procedure does not assume the polyhedron is convex, nor indeed homeomorphic to a sphere. It does assume that the polyhedron is closed (no boundary) and a triangularization of a manifold (which will then be compact and orientable, conditions which I would otherwise have to add). It is not necessary that all the faces be triangles, really, although any other polygons may be so divided. The method may also be extended to other surface integrals besides volume, and so for example may be used to compute the center of mass. One can remove the absolute values and simply add in the polynomial expression if an orientation is chosen consistent with the \"right-hand-rule\" for outward pointing normals. As in the previous post I will concede that there is some redundant calculation here, so that if it is important that the computation be done quickly it pays to watch for repeated line integrals and so on. dave __Derivation of formula for surface integral over one face__ Assuming that the face is not vertical, we can write z = Ax+By+C for some constants A, B and C (easily computed from any three non-collinear vertices on the face). Then that face contributes to the surface integral the sum A integral(x) + B integral(y) + C integral(1) where the integral may be taken over the projection of the face to the xy-plane (translation: ignore the z coordinates on the face). There is an orientation problem: the integral over the projection to the xy-plane will be off by a sign if the polyhedron faces \"in\" rather than \"out\", so you will need to know whether the interior of the polyhedron contains those points whose z coordinates are just larger than Ax+By+C or just smaller. In a previous post, I discussed integrating these very three surface integrals around a polygon. (These were done with Green's theorem.) The upshot is that these integrals may be computed as simple sums around the perimeter of the polygon. The segment from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1) contributes (x0 + x1)/2 . (y1-y0) to the integral of 1 over the polygon, (x0^2 + x0 x1 + x1^2)/6 . (y1-y0) to the integral of x, and ( (y0 x1 + x0 y1) + 2(x1 y1 + x0 y0) )/6 . (y1 - y0) to the integral of y. So, for example, if one face of your polyhedron is a triangle with vertices (x0,y0,z0), (x1,y1,z1), and (x2,y2,z2), then the equation for the plane is z = Ax + By + C where A, B, and C are determined by ( A ) ( x0 y0 1 )^{-1} ( z0 ) ( B ) = ( x1 y1 1 ) ( z1 ) ( C ) ( x2 y2 1 ) ( z2 ) We compute the line integrals around the triangle in the xy-plane: the integral of 1 is I1 = (1/2)( y1.(x0-x2) + y2.(x1-x0) + y0.(x2-x1) ) as in a followup I made to the previous post; the integral of x is this times (x0+x1+x2)/3, and the integral of y is the same factor I1 times (y0+y1+y2)/3. (All these should have their sign adjusted in case the points (x0,y0), (x1,y1), (x2,y2) do not wrap counterclockwise around the triangle. The correction is easy: since integral(1)=Area > 0, the sign correction to multiply by is just the sign S1 of I1. Thus, the surface integral over this face is the linear combination [ A(x0+x1+x2)/3 + B(y0+y1+y2)/3 + C ] . (S1 I1) As it happens, I1 is precisely the determinant of the matrix to be inverted above, so multiplyng thru we see that A B and C may be replaced by the cofactors, making division unnecessary. Apart from the sign correction, the previous surface integral may thus be written (z0.(y1-y2)+z1.(y2-y0)+z2.(y0-y1)) . (x0+x1+x2)/3 + (z0.(x2-x1)+z1.(x0-x2)+z2.(x1-x0)) . (y0+y1+y2)/3 + (z0.(x1y2-x2y1)+z1.(x2y0-x0y2)+z2.(x0y1-x1y0)) This, in turn, simplifies to just (z0+z1+z2)/3 . (I1) (again, times the sign correction so that S1 I1 > 0 ) This is the formula given above."}

Therefore, there is no hope for a polynomial-time algorithm.\n\nFor instance, consider the boolean function $f:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$ that outputs $1$ if its input vector has at least $n/2$ ones (i.e., its Hamming weight is at least $n/2$), and $0$ otherwise. This function can be represented by a polynomial-size monotone formula. However, there are exponentially many minimal $x$ such that $f(x)=1$. In particular, each $x$ of Hamming weight $n/2$ is such a minimal input, and there are ${n \\choose n/2} \\approx 2^n/\\sqrt{n}$ such inputs.\n\nSo, there's no hope.\n\nAs Andrej Bauer points out, a related problem (testing whether there exists an input of Hamming weight at most $k$ that causes the boolean function to output $1$) is also NP-complete; see Prove NP-completeness of deciding satisfiability of monotone boolean formula.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Thanks for both the reasoning and the link provided at the end of the answer.

So you have a finite set of clauses $C_1$, $C_2$, ...,$C_n$.\nand a finite set of variables $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_k$. Each clause contains some literals, i.e., variables $p_i$ and/or negated variable $\\lnot p_i$. (in 3sat we assume that each clause contains at most 3 literals.) We may assume that for each variable $p$ there is a clause $C_p$ containing only $p$ and $\\lnot p$, so $n\\ge k$.\n\nMake S into a graph as follows: There is a special vertex $ s$. For each variable $p$ there are two vertices $p$ and $\\lnot p$, both connected to $s$ (EDITED to simplify) by an edge. There is a vertex for every clause. Each literal $L$ is connected by an edge to each clause $C$ in which $L$ appears.\n\nThe set $M$ will be the set of all clauses.\n\nIf the original problem S was satisfiable, say with an assignment $A$, then then there is an optimal tree with $n+k$ edges: Connect $s$ with all literals which are true under $A$, and connect each clause $C$ with a literal $L$ in $C$ that is true under $A$.\n\n(EDITED to clarify and to close a gap:) Conversely, if there is an optimal graph with at most $n +k$ edges, then:\n\n  1. Each clause has to be on the tree, so it has to be connected to some literal. This costs $n$ edges.\n\n  2. For each variable $p$, either $p$ or $\\lnot p$ has to be on the tree (because of $C_p$), so either $p$ or $\\lnot p$ has to be connected (by an edge) to $s$ (because the distance has to be $1$). These connections cost $k$ edges.\n\n  3. So from each such pair EXACTLY one is connected with $s$. Those literals which are connected to $s$ now define a satisfying truth assignment.\n\nHence the instance $G,M$ of your problem that I constructed from the SAT problem $S$ has a solution of size at most $n+k$ iff $S$ is satisfiable. So any algorithm to solve your problem also solves SAT. Hence your problem is NP-complete.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks a lot goldstern. I thinks this transformation is correct. I just wonder why we don't connect s directly to each variable instead of going through path o length n. That way we can have a tree of n + k edges, can't we? \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 1:18\nanother problem with this transformation is that you're trying to limit the number of edges while the optimal tree must have minimum number of vertices. With the way you select the tree, the number of vertices is not minimum. \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 5:02\nYou are right, the paths are not necessary. I edited my answer to simplify it (and also to clarify some points). \u2013\u00a0 Goldstern May 8 '11 at 8:19\nI do not understand your question about edges vs vertices. A tree with v vertices has v-1 edges. So you minimize the number of edges iff you minimize the number of vertices. \u2013\u00a0 Goldstern May 8 '11 at 8:20\nMaybe I didn't quite understand your proof. So let me give an example. Let say I have a 3SAT (x+y+z)(x+\u00acy+z). We can assign x=y=z=T. So, if we follow the proof, then we will get a tree with 6 vertices and n+k=2+3=5 edges. However, I can have another smaller tree that can have the same shortest paths to vertices in M={C1, C2}. That tree has 3 edges connecting the vertex representing x with s, C1, and C2. It also has only 4 vertices. Am I missing something here? \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 8:48\n\nJust a rough idea: (I am not really an expert on graph theory, so there may be a much better upper bound.)\n\nYou can group the vertices according to their distance to $s$, say\n\n$L_i=\\{v\\in V|dist(s,v)=i\\}$\n\nThen of course the $L_i$ are pairwise disjoint. Any shortest path from $s$ to a given vertex $v$ has to pass the $L_i$ ascending (you can easily proof this fact), so first a vertex from $L_1$, then one from $L_2$, and so on. That means there are at most $\\prod_{i=1}^{dist(s,v)-1}|L_i|$ shortest paths. As $|L_i|\\leq |V|$, you have a polynomial upper bound.\n\nWhile thinking about it: There might be a way to press this bound much lower, as $|L_i|=|V|$ only happens when all vertices have distance 1, which means the shortest path is the direct connection between $s$ and $v$. For decreasing amount of vertices in the $L_i$, the possible length of the path grows. You probably could use this to get a better bound.\n\nI do not see why the rest of your algorithm should not work.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThank you. I didn't have time to verify your proof here but I think the above transformation is correct. \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 1:19\n\nYour Answer"}

That is, $\\sum_1^N &phi;(k)$ is about $3N^2/&pi;^2$, so the difference between the sum to $N+M$ and the sum to $N$ is around $6NM/&pi;^2$, from which it follows that the average value near $N$ is around $6N/&pi;^2$, which is entirely consistent with the well-known fact that the probability that two random integers are coprime is $6/&pi;^2$.\n\nI'm adding this paragraph after Greg's comment. To argue that the probability that two random integers are coprime, you observe that the probability that they do not have p as a common factor is (1-1/p^2).

Since these polynomials have integer coefficients, their resultant is a rational integer.\n\nThe resultant of two polynomials vanishes whenever they have a common root. So $a(n)=0$ if and only if there exists a $n$th root of unity $u$ such that $(u+1)^n+1=0$. This implies that $u$ and $u+1$ are both roots of unity, in particular they belong to the unit circle, so that necessarily $u=e^{2\\pi i/3}$ or $u=e^{-2\\pi i/3}$, and $u+1=e^{\\pm i\\pi/3}$. If $u$ is a $n$th root of unity, one gets $3|n$; if $(u+1)^n=-1$, one obtains that $n/3$ is odd. Conversely, if $n=3m$ with $m$ odd, $u=e^{2\\pi i/3}$ satisfies $u^n=1$, $u\\neq 1$, and $(u+1)^n=-1$, hence $a(n)=0$.\n\nSince the two polynomials $P$ and $Q$ above are monic, their resultant vanishes mod $p$ if and only if they have a common root when considered as polynomials modulo $p$. If $n=p$ is prime, then $X^n-1=(X-1)^p$, so $1$ is the only root of $P$, with multiplicity $p-1$; it follows that $$\u00a0a(n)\\equiv ((1+1)^p+1)^{p-1}\\equiv (2^p+1)^{p-1}\\equiv 3^{p-1} \\pmod p.$$ If, moreover, $p\\neq 3$, then $a(n)\\equiv 1\\pmod p$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

If the snowball melts to 8/27 of its original volume in 20 minutes, determine the time it takes for the snowball to melt completely.", "final_answer": "dr/dt = k and 40 minutes", "raw_text": "Retrieved from http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.09.06/jay1.html\nSubject: Calculus\nName: Jay\nWho are you: Student\n\nA snowball melts at a rate proportional to its surface area. Show that its radius shrinks at a constant rate. If it melts to 8/27 of its original volume in 20 minutes, how long will it take to melt completely? Please I need your help.\n\n\nHi Jay.\n\nLet's take this question step by step: first, the \"snowball melts at a rate...\" is clearly referring to the change in volume of the snowball with respect to time. If V = volume,\nA = surface area and R = radius, then dV/dt is what this phrase means.\n\nNow \"...proportional to its surface area.\" means that the dV/dt (the first part of the sentence) varies directly with the surface area A. Varies directly just means that the two terms are equal, but there is a constant of proportionality (usually called k) as a factor (usually attached to the second term). That means:\n\ndV/dt = kA.\n\nSo that's all the first sentence says.\n\nThe question is \"show that the radius shrinks at a constant rate\". That means the change in radius with respect to time is constant (let's call this constant q). So that means you are asked to show dr/dt is some constant.\n\nThe way to do this is to know the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere:\n\nV = (4/3) \u03c0 r3 and A = 4 \u03c0 r2\n\nand take derivatives.\n\ndV/dt is the derivative of volume with respect to time, but remember that r is also changing, so you have to use the chain rule:\n\ndV/dt = d/dt((4/3) \u03c0 r3) = (4/3) \u03c0 3 r2 (dr/dt)\n\nNow let's plug that into the first equation:\n\n(4/3) \u03c0 3 r2 (dr/dt) = k A = k(4 \u03c0 r2) = 4 \u03c0 k r2\n\nSo when we simplify by dividing left and right sides by 4 \u03c0 r2, we get:\n\ndr/dt = k\n\nwhich is saying exactly what we wanted to prove: that dr/dt is constant.\n\nFor the second (numerical) part of the question, you don't know the\noriginal volume (call it V again), but hopefully it will cancel out\nlater, so just start with what you know. Call the original radius R,\nthe radius after 20 minutes r, and the volume after 20 minutes v,.\n\nV = 4/3 \u03c0 R3\nv = 4/3 \u03c0 r3\nv = (8/27)V\n\nNow use this last equation to tie together the two volume equations:\n\n4/3 \u03c0 r3 = (8/27) (4/3 \u03c0 R3)\n\nso when you simplify and take the cube root,\n\nr = 2/3 R\n\nThat's very useful, because it is saying that the new radius is 2/3 the initial radius. But since the change in radius with respect to time is constant, the radius is shrinking at a constant rate. So if the radius lost 1/3 its length in 20 minutes, it will take another 40 minutes to melt away completely.\n\nStephen La Rocque.>"}

The atmosphere is a really thin film of gas.\n  8. Nov 7, 2009 #7\n\n    I just wanted to point out that you seem to have the wrong idea about air pressure. Air pressure is caused by the space between the molecules. The difference in air pressure with increasing altitude is due to the molecules being farther apart. For example a certain volume of air at the top of Mount Vernon has fewer molecules than the same volume of air at sea level even though the chemical makeup of both volumes of air is the same. But the fact that air pressure decreases with increasing altitude is not the reason that air does not escape into space. The reason is, as so many have stated, gravity.\n  9.

If there were air molecules floating around between the Earth and the Moon (yet not at orbital speed), they would quite simply fall Earthward until they encountered enough bouyancy to keep them aloft.\n  10. Nov 8, 2009 #9\n    Well I certainly find this to be an ambiguous statement.\n  11. Nov 8, 2009 #10\n    Question for Dave: Why do you feel the need to remind us that gravity pulls downward?

Not that it was his/her fault at all...\n\n    It's just that the list of assumptions is large. Ask a dozen people the question without first stating 'all other factors being the same' and you'll get a dozen assumed scenarios - the most obvious of which is 'a bicycle would not get any traction on moondust, so it will fall over before it even gets moving.

Nov 8, 2009 #13\n    Alright, Dave. Why do you think the OP should think carefully about the direction in which gravity always pulls?\n  15. Nov 8, 2009 #14\n    This isn't really a clear answer either.\n  16. Nov 8, 2009 #15\n\n\n    User Avatar\n    Gold Member\n\n    Because the OP clearly seems to think that there is some cause for the air to go flying upwards - and contuinue to fly upwards. Once it loses its initial velocity, there is only one force acting on it, and that force is, of course, downward.\n\n    The OP knows this, he just hasn't realized that it is the most important factor.\n\n    (We are, hopefully, all agreeing to ignore solar winds and such, which will simply complicate the answer without illuminating it.)\n  17. Nov 8, 2009 #16\n    Well, no. The ideal gas equation tells us:\n\n    PV = nRT\n\n    thus pressure and volume vary with the number of moles of gas components and the temperature of the gas. \"Space between the molecules\" doesn't cause the pressure, though it does have a relationship with it. Decrease the volume and you increase the pressure of a given number of moles at a given temperature.\n\n    But change the temperature and the volume a gas occupies increases, so its density decreases. A gas can have the same pressure at a lower density by getting hotter.\n\n    Surface pressure is due to the weight of the air on top of a given area. At Earth's sea-level surface , on average, some 10.33 tons of air is weighing down on every square metre. In fact the pressure at every altitude in the atmosphere is principally caused by the weight of the air above it. Air gets compressed by that weight, so it gets denser the closer we get to the ground. So you're right about the molecules being closer together, but the pressure is from the weight of the air itself.\n\n    But why doesn't it escape? Any mass of gas at a given temperature has a certain amount of energy per unit mass. Temperature is actually a measure of the average energy of the particles of air. At the very top of the atmosphere, where molecules no longer collide with other molecules if they go straight up, then particles with sufficient energy can escape. There's usually a small probability that a fraction of particles will have enough energy to escape, but it's a very low probability. Only hydrogen atoms typically escape in any number because they're the lightest particles and require the least escape energy. This region of the atmosphere is called the exosphere and it is very, very tenuous. The number of particles at the top, in a given volume, is similar to the solar wind.\n  18. Nov 8, 2009 #17\n\n\n    User Avatar\n    Homework Helper\n\n    From wiki:\n\n\n\n    I don't know how much is gained from capture of solar winds.\n  19. Nov 8, 2009 #18\n    Because of its greater mass the escape of helium is much smaller than that of hydrogen but nevertheless is enough to keep the helium content of the atmosphere in reasonable balance,helium constantly being pumped in by the decay of radon gas.\n  20. Nov 9, 2009 #19\n    Radiogenic helium escapes largely via the Polar Wind, which is due to ion pick-up by the Solar Wind around the magnetic poles. Heavier atoms can escape with the Polar Wind that wouldn't otherwise escape, like nitrogen and oxygen. But only a small amount presently does so - mere kilograms per second. As there's thousands of quadrillions of kilograms of atmosphere that means the atmosphere will last for many aeons yet.\n\n    The amount of hydrogen and helium that escape via thermal processes is presently negligible. Not because they can't escape, but because the stratosphere is very dry and so the hydrogen levels available for escape are very low. If the stratosphere became wetter - meaning the troposphere was much hotter - then hydrogen could escape en masse via what's called hydrodynamic outflow. That's how Venus's ocean is believed to have flowed away into space.\n\n    Radon decay is one source of radiogenic helium, though radon itself is produced by uranium decay, of course.\n  21.

Now, we have $n^n$ possible cliques to form. Let's look at the probability that $V_{11},\\dots, V_{nn}$ is a clique. The chance that $V_{11}$ acquires $k$ fixed neighbors in this subgraph when its edges are drawn is $\\frac{(n-1-k)!}{(n-1)!}$. Multiplying by ${n-1\\choose k}$, we see that the chance to get $k$ vertices is less than $\\frac 1{k!}$. Thus, if $X_1$ is the number of acquired neighbors for $V_{11}$, then $Ee^{X_1}\\le e^e$.

Call a member of $B$ a block. A given block intersects $152026$ members of $S$ in 2 or more points. This gives a lower bound of $14$ for the possible size of $B$. Of course this a weak bound since two disjoint blocks determine $200$ members of $S$ intersecting one in 2 points and the other in 3 and another $4000$ intersecting each in 2 points. If my calculations are correct, that raises the lower bound to at least $19$ blocks. I doubt that $20$ would suffice.\n\nSo far my record is 44 blocks.\n\nLet me digress for some terminology (which I'll try to keep fairly standard). a design is a pair $D=(V,B)$ where $V$ is a set of $v$ vertices and a $B$ is a collection of subsets called blocks There are various names for designs which satisfy additional conditions. Two are\n\nEvery pair of points is in exactly one common block. (Then $D$ is called a linear space)\n\nEvery pair of points is in at least one common block and every block has the same number $k$ of points. (Then $D$ is called a $(v,k,2)$-covering design and the La Jolla Repository has information about these.)\n\nWhen both conditions hold, $D$ is called a Steiner System $S(2,k,v).$ Many that one encounters arise from algebraic constructions. This is perhaps due to the Streetlight effect.\n\nI'll coin the term super-linear space for a design such that every pair of points from $V$ occur in at least one common block but the blocks may have various sizes (since I don't know a standard name. It turns out that this might be called a lottery wheel although that term is not very specific)\n\nYou have $50$ points and do not require that every pair of points is in a block but do wish that from every 5 points (element of $S$), at least one pair is in at least one block. You also want all blocks to have $5$ points. I'll find it convenient to only require that each block have at most 5 points, then one can arbitrarily enlarge blocks to size 5.\n\nAll my constructions have this form: Split the points into 4 groups (or 2 or 3) and for each group take a super-linear space with no block having more than 6 points. Then any element of $S$ has two points in the same group and those two points are in a common block. Perhaps one can do better without this restriction. I include a few other possibilities in case it inspires anyone to get a better result.\n\n44* blocks. Split into 4 groups of size 21,21,4 and 4. For each of the large groups take the 21 lines of a projective plane of order 4 and let the two small groups be 4 point blocks. Now any set in $S$ has at least two points in a common group and those two pints determine a unique block.\n\n60 blocks: split the points into two sets of 25 and use the 30 lines of an affine plane of order 5 on each. This is overkill because any 3 element set has two points in some block. Perhaps there is a way to cull out some of the lines.\n\nUnder 52 blocks If the points are partitioned into 3 groups of 13 and one of 11 (with two fake points added in) then (for each group) the lines of a projective plane of order 3 were taken as blocks this would give a solution with 52 blocks of size 4. Delete $X,Y$ to improve this to 45 of size 4 and 6 of size 3 and one of size two. Now tack the block of size 2 onto a block of size 3 to get $51$ blocks (one of size 5). (If $X,Y$ are in different groups it might be better, I haven't checked.) One can also get rid of at least 3 more blocks as follows: take a block abcd, delete it and add b as a fifth point to a block containing c and another containing c, add c as a fifth point to two blocks containing d and a and add d as a fifth point to two blocks containing a and b.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nThanks a lot! How would you recommend to build the projective 3 space of order 4? I think I'm currently not ready for this task :(. \u2013\u00a0chous Jun 7 '11 at 12:18\nAaron Meyerowitz's construction for $42$ blocks used $F_3$ rather than $F_4$, which should make it easier. The construction is just like that of $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ so that the points are lines passing through the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ and the lines of $\\mathbb{P}^3$ correspond to (two-dimensional) planes passing through the origin. $\\mathbb{P}^3(F_4)$ has $(4^4-1)/(4-1)=85$ points, though. \u2013\u00a0Douglas Zare Jun 7 '11 at 17:53\n$\\mathbb{P}^3(F_3)$ has ${40 \\choose 2}/{4 \\choose 2} = 130$ lines, not $40$, so the construction for $42$ blocks actually uses $132$ blocks. It was a little too good to be true since it would mean any quadruple would intersect a block in $2$ points, and it would be easy to use the $5$th points to make a line redundant. \u2013\u00a0Douglas Zare Jun 7 '11 at 18:40\n\nHere is a construction of size $38$. Call the points cards and divide the deck into $4$ suits, so that $2$ suits have ranks $1,...,13$ and $2$ suits have ranks $1,...,12$. Every hand of $5$ cards must have at least $2$ cards in some suit. So, if we cover all possible pairs in each suit, the result will be a wheel.\n\nThe La Jolla Covering Repository says that $C(12,5,2)=9$ so we can cover all pairs within the short suits with $9$ hands each:\n\n1  2  4  7  9 \n1  3  4  6 12 \n1  3  7 10 11 \n1  5  6  8 12 \n2  3  5  7  8 \n2  6 10 11 12 \n3  6  7  9 12 \n4  5  8 10 11 \n5  8  9 10 11 \n\nSimilarly, it says $C(13,5,2) \\le 10$ so we can cover all pairs within the long suits with $10$ hands each:\n\n1  2  3  4  5\n1  6  7  8  9\n1 10 11 12 13\n2  3  6  7 10\n2  3  8  9 11\n4  5  6  7 11\n4  5  8  9 10\n2  3  4 12 13\n5  6  7 12 13\n1  8  9 12 13\n\nThe total is $38$ hands which intersect each hand of $5$ cards in at least $2$ cards. So, $L(50,5,5,2) \\le 38$.\n\nEdit: The best this method can do with the coverings known in the La Jolla Repository is $37$. That can be done by splitting a $50$ card deck into suits of sizes $(17, 11, 11, 11),$ $(13,13,13,11)$, or $(15, 13, 11, 11)$.\n\n$C(17,5,2) \\le 16$.\n\n$C(15,5,2) \\le 13$.\n\n$C(13,5,2) \\le 10$ as shown above.\n\n$C(11,5,2) \\le 7$.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nThanks (truly!) for clarifying the question and making my LJCR comment less useful (since a covering design was not wanted) and also more useful (by showing how two covering designs could help).

In the solution with suits of size 11,11,11,17 and covering designs of sizes 7,7,7,16, each covering design has a block which can be reduced to 3 cards. Take the 3 card blocks abc def ghi jkl and replace them by abcjk defjl ghikl. In fact one of the pairs from jkl ( in the 17 card suit) has a pair already covered so one could leave one of the hands with three cards. \u2013\u00a0Aaron Meyerowitz Jun 10 '11 at 5:38\n\nYour Answer"}

One way, since you've observed that your exponent $x$ is necessarily odd, would be to find all the integral points on the elliptic curves given by the equations $$ y^2 = 13^\\delta u^4+12 \\; \\mbox{ for } \\; \\delta \\in \\{ 1, 3 \\}. $$ One can do this in, for example, magma by typing : IntegralQuarticPoints([13,0,0,0,12]); and IntegralQuarticPoints([13^3,0,0,0,12]); which lead to the two known solutions (with $|u|=1$ and $|y| =5$ and $47$). These routines are using lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms (elliptic, I believe).\n\nAnother approach (which has some similarities) would be to use an argument of de Weger (from his thesis, again based on linear forms in logarithms). This would enable you, for example, to tackle the more general equation $$ 13^x + 2^y 3^z = w^2. $$ I haven't worked out the details, but one should be able to show that the only solutions are with $$ \\begin{array}{r} (x,y,z) = (0,0,1), (0,3,0), (0,3,1), (0,4,1), (0,5,2), (1,0,1), (1,0,5), \\\\ (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (1,2,3), (2,0,3), (2,6,1), (2,10,5), (3,2,1). \\\\ \\end{array} $$\n\nYet another way to solve such problems is to use the hypergeometric method of Thue and Siegel. In this context, it enables one to prove an inequality of the shape $$ \\left| y^2 - 13^x \\right| > |y|^{0.4}, $$ valid for all integers $y$ and odd $x$. Such an approach is also useful for bounding the number of solutions to equations like the one under consideration here. One can, for example, show that given any odd prime $p$ and integer $D$, there are at most $3$ positive integers $x$ such that $$ p^x+D = y^2 $$ for integer $y$. This is, of course, not quite sharp when $p=13$ and $D=12$, but it's close.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI may be two weeks late, but welcome to Math Stack Exchange professor Bennett! \u2013\u00a0 Eric Naslund Feb 7 '13 at 18:59\nThank you, Eric. \u2013\u00a0 Mike Bennett Feb 8 '13 at 1:57\n\n$x=3 \\implies 13^x+12=2209=47^2$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nI don't think there's a nice way to do this.

A quick exhaust shows $a > 0$ too. Subtracting the conjugates on both sides, you get what is essentially a quadratic equation in $(2 - \\sqrt{3})^a$, so there is effectively one solution for each choice of $(4 \\pm \\sqrt{3})^x$.

Oct 1, 2006 #4\n    Lets say you throw the ball against the wall and no energy is lost whatsoever. You would expect the ball to hit the wall and bounce back. If the ball loses no energy, then you also expect that its final speed is equal to its initial speed (in the opposite direction). Now examine it's momentum. Initially it had\n\n    p_0 = +mv\n\n    while finally it has\n\n    P_1 = -mv\n\n    This is a net momentum \"gain\" of |2mv| for the ball in the direction anti-parrallel to its initial velocity. Where has the momentum gone (or come from)?\n\n    The answer is that the wall suffers a net \"gain\" of -|2mv| of momentum. If the wall is fixed then the gain in momentum will be manifest as phonons (vibrations) in the wall. This is why someone else on the other side of the wall would hear you throwing the ball against it.\n\n    So momentum is conserved in the entire collision. It's just not very useful for calculating the longitudinal component of momentum for your ball.\n\nHave something to add?\n\nSimilar Discussions: Momentum question.\n  1.

For if, for example, $G_A = G_B = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (thought of as the set $\\{0,1\\}$), but we define $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = 0$, then I think $f$ is an isomorphism according to your definition, but it isn't actually an isomorphism.\n\nFirst, it's not an isomorphism (according to the usual notion of isomorphism) because it doesn't map the identity to the identity, so it's not even a homomorphism.\n\nOn the other hand, $$A = B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\1&0 \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n\nThen, one can check that $A_{00} = A_{11}$ and $B_{f(0)f(0)} = B_{f(1)f(1)}$, and similarly that $A_{01} = A_{10}$ and $B_{f(0)f(1)} = B_{f(1)f(0)}$.\n\n\nIn fact, it's worse than I thought. In the example I gave, the 2 groups were actually isomorphic, but we have the following fact:\n\nIf $G_A$ and $G_B$ have the same number of elements, then they must be \"isomorphic\" according to your definition. Let $f:G_A\\rightarrow G_B$ be any constant map. Then we have $B_{f(a)f(b)} = B_{f(x)f(y)}$ for any choices of $a,b,x,y$.\n\nSo, for example, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}\\times \\mathbb{Z}2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ are \"isomorphic\" according to your definition, but they aren't isomorphic at all.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nThe condition (which I\u2019ll call $P$) actually does say something interesting if we add the assumption that $f$ is a bijection.\n\nTheorem.

Suppose first that $f$ has property $P$. Note first that if $a,b\\in G$ and $ab=ba$, then $f(a)f(b)=f(b)f(a)$, so $f(1_G)\\in Z(H)$. Let $z=f(1_G)$, and define $h:G\\to H:g\\mapsto f(g)z^{-1}$.

Frequently Asked Questions Referencing NEWTON About NEWTON About Ask A Scientist Education At Argonne Spirals... Circles... Radius\nName: Name\nStatus: N/A\nAge: N/A\nLocation: N/A\nCountry: N/A\nDate: Around 1993\n\nQuestion: Is there any mathematical formula for determining the un-rolled length of a spiral? For instance, if I had a roll of ribbon that had a radius of two inches, and the ribbon was one sixteenth of an inch thick, how long would the ribbon be? If there is not a formula for it, what would be the best way to determine this?\n\nA very close approximation for this kind of spiral is to pretend that the roll of ribbon is a series of concentric circular loops of ribbon. Then, the length of each loop is 2 * pi * r, where r = the loop's radius and pi = 3.1415926...so the answer for your example would be: 2 * pi * (1/16 + 2/16 + 3/16 + ... + 32/16) = 2 * pi * 528/16. If the ribbon was on a spindle of radius, say, 1 inch, the sum would be (16/16 + 17/16 + ... + 32/16). An interesting related problem is find (and prove) a formula for ( 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N ) John Hawley\n\nHere is another approach. If we assume that the ribbon is tightly wound up (i.e., no gaps between the layers of ribbon), then the volume occupied by the 'disk' of wound-up ribbon equals the volume of the unwound strip (a very flat and long 'box'). Let R denote the radius of the 'disk', T the thickness of the ribbon, L its unwound length (the quantity we want to compute), and W its width. The wound-up volume is pi*R^2*W (\"R^2 means \"R squared\"), and the unwound volume is L*W*T. Setting these equal and solving for L, we get L = pi*R^2/T. For the values given (R=2 in., T=1/16 in.), we get L = 64*pi (about 201) inches. By the way, your idea of using a spiral would work. One could write an equation (polar coordinates would be the easiest choice) for a curve that would lie within the ribbon-say, at mid- interior. There is a formula for length of a curve, using integral calculus. As it happens, the answer you get is the same as that obtained above. If you would like more details on this calculus approach, please ask (here or via e- mail).\n\nRon Winther\n\nClick here to return to the Mathematics Archives\n\n\n\nEducational Programs\nBuilding 360\n9700 S.

{"problem": "Given a 90% probability of an event occurring within the first year and a 95% probability of it occurring eventually, what is the probability that the event will occur after the first year if it does not happen within that timeframe?", "final_answer": "50%", "raw_text": "Retrieved from http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/281604/probability-of-an-event-after-time-has-passed/281618\nTake the 2-minute tour \u00d7\n\nA friend of mine posed this problem and we have had a disagreement on the answer.\n\nThe problem:\n\n  \u2022 There is a 90% chance that some event will happen in the next year.\n  \u2022 There is a 95% chance that the event will happen eventually.\n  \u2022 What is the probability that it happens after this year, if it does not happen in the next year?\n\nHover over here for a description of our answers and arguments:\n\nI told my friend that it is 95%. My reasoning is that there is a 95% chance that it happens from now to infinity. The probability that it happens from now to infinity minus one year is still 95%. In one year, when it hasn't happened, events that didn't happen don't affect your \"eventual\" odds.\n\nMy friend on the other hand, believes it to be 50%. He had two arguments. First, he said if you flip a coin 4 times, the chance that you get heads the first time is 50%, but the chance that you get heads eventually is 93.75% (15/16). If you don't get it the first time, what is the chance that you get it after the first time? 87.5% (7/8), in other words, it has decreased.\n\nTo this I responded that the \"eventually\" is based on a finite set of events, each with their own probability and after the first event has passed, you have fewer chances. In his problem, on the other hand, it is a summary of the probability of unknown events broken in two time periods.\n\nHe continued to insist that it is the same because you have two time periods with known odds. The 95% is the combination of two probabilities, 90% and 50%. Eliminating the first 90%, the probability of the remaining period is 50%.\n\nI agreed that's an accurate way to look at it from now, but I don't think that's accurate once you know it did not happen in that time period.\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n7 Answers 7\n\nLet's use Bayes' Theorem: \\begin{equation} P(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}.\\end{equation} In our case, $B$ is the event whatnot does not occur in year 1 (so with probability $P(B)=.1$, and $A$ is the event whatnot occurs at some point (so with probability $P(A)=0.95$). Of course, $P(B|A)$ is the only thing left to determine, but notice that $P(A|not(B))=1$ since if whatnot occurs in year 1, then it occurs at some point. Therefore, again by Bayes' Theorem \\begin{equation} P(not(B)|A)=\\frac{P(A|not(B)) P(not(B))}{P(A)}=\\frac{90}{95}.\\end{equation} Since $P(not(B)|A)+P(B|A)=1$, we have that $P(B|A)=\\frac{5}{95}$. Hence plugging this all in, we find \\begin{equation}P(A|B)=\\frac{\\frac{5}{95} \\frac{95}{100}}{\\frac{10}{100}}=\\frac{1}{2}. \\end{equation} So it looks like your friend was right!\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nCalculate it this way. Given that the probability that it occurs during or after year 2 is $x$%. And the probability it occurs in year 1 is 90%, what is the probability it occurs?\n\nNow, consider $x=0$, then the probability the event occurs is 90%.\n\nIf $x=50$, then it is 95%. (because it is $0.9 \\times 1 + 0.1 \\times 0.5 \\times 1= 0.95$)\n\nThis informal argument should convince you.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nAfter talking about it some more, we came up with this scenario which illustrates why he is correct, and I am wrong.\n\n  1. Say I want to give him a 90% chance that he will get $100 this year, 95% chance total, and 5% chance that he gets nothing.\n\n  2. So, I take 100 sheets of paper and write dates in the next year on 90 of them, dates after that on 5, and \"Bad luck\" on the other 5.\n\n  3. I draw one at random and keep it a secret.\n\n  4. A year passes and my friend got nothing. Now he knows that all 90 dates this year are still in the pile. He now knows I must hold one of the other 10 sheets. That makes a 5/10 chance that I have a sheet with a date on it, and 5/10 chance that the sheet I hold has \"Bad luck\" on it. 50% chance he will get $100.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nNice. Beats Bayes. \u2013\u00a0 Andr\u00e9 Nicolas Jan 18 '13 at 21:15\n\nLet $A$ represent the cases in which the event happens eventually. Let $B$ represent the cases in which the event happens next year. You've stipulated $P(A)=0.95$ and $P(B)=0.90$. Because $B$ is a subset of $A$, $P(A\\cap B)=P(B)=0.90$, and $$P(A\\cap \\neg B)=P(A)-P(A\\cap B)=0.95-0.90=0.05.$$ By the definition of conditional probability, then, $$ P(A|\\neg B)=\\frac{P(A\\cap \\neg B)}{P(\\neg B)}=\\frac{0.05}{0.10}=\\frac{1}{2}. $$ So if I propose a deal right now, under the terms of which (a) you'll put in $\\$1000$ if the event hasn't happened after one year and (b) you'll get back $X$ if the event happens after next year, then you should take the deal if $X>\\$2000$. In this sense, your friend is right.\n\nYour point, though, is different. You're wondering what deal you should take a year from now if the event hasn't happened by then. The answer is that it depends on probabilities not stipulated in the problem. In particular, you may learn something from the fact that it didn't happen this year, which may raise or lower these odds.\n\nSuppose the event is the earth being hit by a meteor, that this depends on the solar system's meteor density, and that we're building a meteor shield that will be operational in just over a year. Based on what we know now, the meteor density might be high or low, with equal likelihood; if it's high, then the earth will be hit in the next year with probability $1$ (no shield yet!); if it's low, then the earth will be hit next year with probability $0.8$ and eventually with probability $0.9$. A year from now, if the earth hasn't been hit yet, you will know that the meteor density is low, and that the remaining probability that we'll ever be hit is $0.1$. In this case, the odds were lowered.\n\nOn the other hand, the choice may be between cases where the event will happen in either eighteen months with certainty (so next year with probability $0$ and eventually with probability $1$), or at some indeterminate time (next year with probability $0.9/(1-\\varepsilon)$ and eventually with probability $(0.95-\\varepsilon)/(1-\\varepsilon)$), based on some unknown variable that might point to the first case (with probability $\\varepsilon$) but almost surely points to the second (with probability $1-\\varepsilon$). Here, a year from now you'll be much more likely to believe that the unknown variable is pointing to the first case, which will increase the odds that the event is still forthcoming.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nThere could be slight issue with the phrasing of the problem. Your interpretation is that the statement is true no matter what time period you are in. I.e. in 5 years time, there is still a 90% chance that some event will happen in that year. However, you're forgetting to account for the fact that the event didn't happen in the first year.\n\nYour friend's interpretation, is that your statement is true for this year. He has ignored the probability space in which the event occurred this year, and considered the remaining probability space. This now has measure $1-0.9=0.1$, and we know that the event has $0.95 - 0.9 = 0.05$ measure to occur, so it has $\\frac {0.05}{0.1} = 50\\%$ chance to happen.\n\nFor example, consider the event where outcomes are based on drawing a uniform random variable on $[0,1]$. Let $C$ be your favorite number from 0 to 0.9.\n\nIf we draw a number from 0 to 0.9, the event happens this year.\nIf we draw a number from $X$ to 0.95, the event happens next year.\nIf we draw a number from 0.95 to 1, the event never happens.\n\nA possible scenario describing your interpretation, could be\n\nIf we draw a number from 0 to 0.9, the event happens every even year.\nIf we draw a number from 0.05 to 0.95, the event happens every odd year.\n\nThen, it will always be true, that there is a 90% chance of it happening this year, and a 95% chance of it happening eventually. However, not that if we know it doesn't happen in this year (doesn't matter whether it's even or odd), then there's only a 50% chance that it will ever happen again.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks for the alternate scenario, that's interesting. This is the kind of thing that made me feel like it's hard to guarantee an answer in the first place. \u2013\u00a0 NickC Jan 18 '13 at 21:25\n@NickC The hard part is considering completely what it means for an event to not occur. You should look at this recent post, which had a lot of different answers initially. \u2013\u00a0 Calvin Lin Jan 18 '13 at 21:29\n\nIn case the mathematical proof already mentioned above isn't enough to convince you, pretend you're a statistician collecting your own results. You have 100 people infected with a disease that has a 95% death rate and a 90% death rate in the first year. Year one is finished, 90 dead, as predicted. 10 people left. We know 95% will be dead at some point. How many more are likely to die if the odds hold true? 5/10. Chances once the first year has passed is 50%. You don't need to be a statistician to see that. It has nothing to do with a finite number of events or an infinite time frame. That part has already been calculated for us in the given 95%.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nThe analysis for this appears to be relatively straightforward. Assume the probability of event in year 2+ is $x$. Next, the probability that the event does not occur in the first year is $0.1$ and that it does not occur any time thereafter is $(1-x)$. The product of the two is the probability that the event never happens, which we know to be $ 0.05$. So,\n\n$0.1 \\times (1-x) = 0.05$\n\nsolving for x yields $x=\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

If AC fails, then no x can have C(x). Thus, ZF+\u00acAC proves that no x has C(x).\n\nBut ZFC proves that C(0) holds, and so it proves that Q={0} is the desired set.\n\n\nThe set { x | C(x) } is an indicator set for AC, in the sense that it is either 0 or 1, depending exactly on whether AC holds. A similar trick works to construct indicator sets for any assertion.\n\nI have suggested that the question be focused on the possibility of projective statements C(x). A projective statement is one expressible in the language of second order number theory, with quantifiers over real numbers and natural numbers. Thus, the question would be whether there is a specific projective statement C(x) such that ZFC proves that Q = { x | C(x) } is nonempty, but ZF does not.\n\nThis version of the question is exactly equivalent to the question of whether ZFC is not conservative over ZF for projective sentences, since if there is a counterexample C(X), then the assertion $\\exists x C(x)$ is provable in ZFC but not ZF, and if $\\sigma$ is provable in ZFC but not in ZF, then the set {x | $\\sigma$} is ZFC provably all of the reals, but ZF is consistent with this set being empty.\n\nTherefore, the question amounts to: Is ZFC not conservative over ZF for projective statements?\n\nI think it is not, but I don't have a counterexample.\n\nMeanwhile, I can say that if one replaces ZF here with ZF+DC, looking at the difference between the full Axiom of Choice and the Axiom of Dependent Choices, rather than at the difference between full AC and no AC at all, then the answer is that it IS conservative. In this MO answer, I explained that ZFC is conservative over ZF+DC for projective sentences, and so if one replaces ZF with ZF+DC in the question, the answer would be no. But without DC, weird things can happen in the reals, and I'm not yet quite sure about it.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIn this case, the formula asserting that there is such a nonempty Q is exactly equivalent to AC. You could replace AC in this argument with any statement whatsoever; what you get is a kind of indicator set for the truth of that statement. It is empty when the statement fails, and it is 1 when the statement holds. \u2013\u00a0 Joel David Hamkins Apr 22 '10 at 20:05\nI take this answer to show that you will want to revise your question.

The straightforward way\nis incredibly long and messy, but there's a quick way if you look\nat it right.  The key is the Chain Rule for derivatives.\nDrop a perpendicular from B to the road CA and let that be the\norigin of a coordinate system with +x toward C and +y toward B.\nThis origin is 250 metres from A and 250*sqrt(3) metres from B.\nThe only *physical explanation* I see is the observation that\nBX is least exactly when the vehicle location X is at the origin.\nTo keep consistent units, use 20 metres per second rather than \n72kph.  With respect to some arbitrary reference time t=0 let p(t)\nbe the x-coordinate of the vehicle location on road CA at time \nt seconds.  If the reference time is when the vehicle is M metres\nfrom the origin, then p(t) = M-20t and p'(t) = -20 is constant.\nLet d(t) be the distance BX at time t seconds, and a(t) be the\nangle BXA at time t seconds.  Then cos(a(t)) = p(t)/d(t).  \nTake derivatives of both sides to get : \n                             d(t)*p'(t) - p(t)*d'(t)  \n       -sin(a(t)) * a'(t) = ------------------------- \nYou want to solve for a'(t) when BX is least, which is when X is\nat the origin, a(t) = pi/2, and d'(t) = 0 for a d(t) minimum.\nAnswer: (2/75)*sqrt(3) or about 0.046188 radians per second.\nI hope this is what you were looking for. \n\n-Doctor Mike,  The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nHigh School Calculus\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM\n\u00a9 1994-2013 The Math Forum"}

Suppose first that $n = p^aq^b$ with $p,q$ prime, $a,b>0$, and suppose that $p^a > q^b$. Let $c$ be minimal such that $p^a$ divides $q^c-1$ - so clearly $c > b$. Then a faithful irreducible module for the cyclic group of order $p^a$ over the field of order $q$ has dimension $c$. (You can define the action explicitly as multiplication by an element $x$ in the field of order $q^c$, where $x$ has multiplicative order $p^a$.)\n\nNow let $G = Q \\rtimes P$ be the semidirect product of an elementary abelian group $Q$ of order $q^c$ by a cyclic group $P$ of order $p^a$, using this module action. So $Q$ is the unique minimal normal subgroup of $G$. A subgroup of $G$ of order $p^aq^b$ would have a normal subgroup of order $q^b$ which would also be normal in $Q$ and hence normal in $G$, contradiction, so there is no such subgroup.\n\nFor the general case, let $n = p^aq^br$ where $r$ is coprime to $p$ and $q$. Then a direct product of $G$, as constructed above, with a cyclic group of order $r$ has no subgroup of order $n$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nNice! Thank you for this elegant proof.

If we prove all the intervals $I(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$, $x_i \\in X$ have a common point, we are done. To prove it, it is enough to establish any two of them have a common point, by Helly's theorem combined with the finite intersection property of a family of compact sets. Arguing by contradiction suppose $I(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$ and $I(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n)$ do not intersect and let $a$ be a real number that separates them. Suppose without loss of generality that$$f_n(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n, x) < a < f_n(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n, y) \\text{ for all }x,y \\in X.$$Now, in the first inequality substitute consecutively $x = y_1$, $x = y_2$, $\\ldots$ , $x = y_n$ and sum the terms. Then do the same with the second one substituting $y = x_1$, $y = x_2$, $\\ldots$ , $y = x_n$. We get that one and the same sum is both less and greater than $a$, a contradiction. Thus all the intervals have a common intersection, which is a nonempty interval $I_n$.\n  2. We prove all $I_n$, $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ have a common point. Again, it is enough to prove it for any two of them. Let us first observe that$$m \\mid n \\implies I_n \\subset I_m.$$Indeed let $c \\in I_n$ and let $x_i \\in X$, $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m$. Then we get $k$ copies of each $x_i$, $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m$, where $k \\cdot m = n$ and apply what $c \\in I_n$ means for the new $n$ points in $X$. Using that observation, for any $m$, $n$ we have$$I_{mn} \\subset I_m, \\quad I_{mn} \\subset I_n,$$which means $I_n$, $I_m$ have nonempty intersection. Thus, all $I_n$ have nonempty intersection and any $\\alpha$ inside that intersection will do the job.\n\nYour Answer"}

Jan 7, 2010 #1\n    I have a rigid body rotating in 3D space. I have a torque vector that I want to apply to the rotating body over a given time step. What I want to know is, will the torque be enough to stop the body rotating on any of its axis and reverse direction, and, if so, exactly what would the torque vector be to stop the rotation instead of reverse it. The angular velocity is known, and the inertia tensor is known, so I am calculating the angular momentum as I * w.\n\n    The background to this is that I'm simulating the friction of a particular point on a body in space, and often times the torque created by the friction is more than adequate to stop the body from rotating, and if I apply the full friction-caused torque to the body, it actually rotates in the opposite direction, when what I really want to do is simply stop the rotation.\n  2. jcsd\n  3. Jan 8, 2010 #2\n\n\n    User Avatar\n    Science Advisor\n\n    Torque is the change of the angular momentum over time. If you know what change of angular momentum you want to achieve (to stop the rotation it is the negative of the current angular momentum) and the time period you want to apply the torque it rather trivial:\n    Torque = dL / dt\n  4. Jan 8, 2010 #3\n    Thanks for the reply. My problem is that I don't know how to determine if a given torque will stop the rotation over time. I understand how to find out the impulse to stop the rotation completely, but that's not what I necessarily want to do. I've got a torque that's working against the rotation, and at most, I want to stop the rotation rather than reverse it. I was thinking of doing a component-wise comparison, but I'm not sure if that's a valid approach. Basically, something like this:\n\n    I have an angular momentum of [1,2,3]. In order to stop the rotation in 1 second, I'd apply a torque of [-1,-2,-3]. But, the torque vector I want to apply is [0,-2,-4]. Would I be able to simply compare components and determine that the force I want to apply without reversing any rotational direction would be [0,-2,-3]?\n  5.

Possibly some information is missing\n\n    The whole idea of a simulation is that you set up the equations in such a way that blatantly unphysical outcomes are inherently impossible.\n\n    In the case of friction the quick 'n dirty approximation is to make the amount of friction proportional to the velocity. Then by the time the rotation has been reduced to zero the torque is down to zero.\n  6.

I thought it\u2019d be interesting to do the sums. (I\u2019m writing this in the summer, though - and while my house has a technical sea view ((It\u2019s over there, between the land and the sky)), I\u2019m not getting up early just to test it out.)\n\nSetting up the puzzle\n\nSo, to start with, I\u2019m going to assume that the sun\u2019s light shines in the plane of my circle of latitude. I\u2019m also going to assume that I\u2019m two metres tall, because that\u2019s a nice number. I\u2019m also going to assume that my circle of latitude is a lot more than 2m in radius. I\u2019ll call that radius $r$; the time between the observations is $T$.\n\nI\u2019m then going to set up two right-angled triangles. The first, standing on top of the wall, has a hypotenuse of $r + 4$ and a long leg of $r$. Pythagoras says that the short leg is $\\sqrt{8r+16}$, which - because $r \\gg 2 \\gt 1$ - I\u2019ll call $\\sqrt{8r}$.\n\nThe second, from the floor, has a hypotenuse of $r+2$ and a short leg of $r$, and using similar reasoning, a short leg of $\\sqrt{4r}$.\n\nGetting into the angles\n\nThe angle turned by the earth between the two observations is the difference between the small angles in the two triangles. Supposing they\u2019re small enough to use the small angle approximation ((which seems reasonable, the triangle is right-angled and pretty much isosceles)) $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$ , the difference between the angles is $\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{8r}}{r}-\\frac{\\sqrt{4r}}{r}$, or $\\frac{2\\br{\\sqrt{2}-1)}}{\\sqrt{r}}$.\n\nWe also know, by virtue of having timed it, what fraction of a day has passed between the two observations - so $\\theta = 2\\pi T$, measured in days.\n\nSince $T=\\frac{\\br{\\sqrt{2}-1}}{\\pi\\sqrt{r}}$, we can rearrange to get $r\\approx \\br{ \\frac{ \\br{\\sqrt{2}-1} } {\\pi T} }^2$. Switching to numbers, we get $r \\approx \\frac{0.0173}{T^2}$.\n\nAdjusting for latitude\n\nNow, since Weymouth is at 50.6\u00ba north ((pretty much the only time it\u2019s excusable to use degrees)), the radius of the circle of latitude is $R_E \\cos\\left(50.6\u00ba\\right)$. That\u2019s something like $\\frac{2}{3}R_E$ (($0.635R_E$, it says here.))\n\nThat gives us $R_E \\approx \\frac{0.0173}{0.635 T^2}$, or about $\\frac{0.02737}{T^2}$, where $T$ is measured in days.\n\nChecking it\u2019s reasonable\n\nIt\u2019s good to go through the motions of checking that that\u2019s a reasonable answer. After all, we know the radius of the earth: it\u2019s about $6.4 \\times 10^6$ m. Rearranging, we have $T \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02737}{R_E}}$, which is about $\\frac{0.1654}{2.5 \\times 10^3}$ days, or 0.066 millidays. A centiday is about 15 minutes, which is in turn a kilosecond - so a milliday is about 100 seconds, and - assuming all is well - the time between observations ought to work out as around 7 ((Calculator work says 5.7)) seconds.

It's clear that the fifth digit has to be 5. b, d, f and h are elements of {2,4,6,8} and the remaining a, c, g and i are elements of {1,3,7,9}. So there are at most 24 * 24 = 576 possibilities. But we can limit these possibilities drastic. 2c + d has to be divisible by 4, 4d + 20 + 4f by 6 and 2g + h by 4. Now you will find only one possibility: 381654729\n\nBest answer by far.\n\nplease explain the 2nd to last line about divisibility\n\nI found at least two numbers 921,252,564 and 987,654,564\n\nI don't think you heard the question correctly. go back and listen taking note about how many times each digit can appear\n\nerrrr. I don't think you heard the question right. It said you could only use every digit once...\n\nE=5 because multiples of 5 end in 5 or 0\nAlternate digits must be even, so the rest have to be odd.\nDigits C and D have to go \"odd,even\", and make a number which is a multiple of 4. So D has to be 2 or 6.\nDitto position H- must be 2 or 6.\nThe only even numbers left are 4 and 8, and these must go in B and F.\nLooking at the first three digits, whose digital root must be 3,6 or 9, there are 9 options for filling these given the conditions we've already worked out.\nWe tried each of these in turn and worked out the digital root up to F. This also has to be 3,6 or 9 to make it divisible by 6. So you can work out in each case whether D is 2 or 6.\nFrom this we can see what H is as one of its options has been used.\nOnly two digits remain- we test whether either makes a multiple of 7 when put in position G.\nFinding that one of these works, check that the first 8 digits are divisible by 8.\nAfter this only one answer remains:\n\n(Also, has anyone noticed the patterns this and other suggestions make on the calculator buttons? They are symmetrical or generally interesting.)\nIf you followed that, I'm impressed. :)\n\nHow come the digits need to alternate even/odd?\n\nBecause even numbers are evenly divisible only by other even numbers.\n\n\n123456789 is also a correct answer .\n\nSorry 1234 is not divisible by 4\n\n123456789 is not a correct answer I'm afraid :(\n\n\nSorry not correct because 986 is not divisible by 3\n\nhere i have one possible solution.\n\nSorry this is not correct because all the number 1..9 should occur once\n\nI found this in 15 seconds, mentally. 14 here.\n\n2431 is not divisible by 4.\n\nIf we generalize this problem to other bases, these are what you get.\n\nFor Base 2 (binary), there are no solutions.\n\nFor Base 4 (quaternary), there are two solutions: 123 and 321.\n\nFor Base 6 (senary), there are two solutions: 14325 and 54321.\n\nFor Base 8 (octal), there are six solutions: 1274563, 3254167, 5234761, 5614723, 5674321, and 7234561.\n\nI have yet to do the odd bases or the bases higher than 10 (decimal).\n\nFor Base 2 an admittedly somewhat trivial solution becomes apparent if you append a final zero as you can in the case of any base b so that you get a final number divisible by b as well. So you can divide 1 by 1 in Base 2, and then 10 by 2 (ie divide 10 by 10 base 2) just as you can divide 3816547290 by 10 Base 10.\n\nBy my reckoning three of the solutions you give for octals are in error: 127456 and 561472 aren't divisible by 6, and in the last, 723 isn't divisible by 3.\n\nBut hey, the other three are three more than what I found!\n\nHave you got anywhere with solutions for other bases? One clue is that for an even base b the middle number must be b/2, so 6 for base 12 as 5 for 10, 4 for 8 etc.\n\nI'm embarrassed to report that your solutions for octals are correct after all. (Editor: Please remove that bit of my reply if you can!!)\n\nIt's me again - I said that my post in reply to \"Generalizing to other bases\" erroneously attributed an error, but I just checked again and find I was in fact right after all, the contributor had indeed made a mistake in some of his solutions, so best let my first reply stand. But please do some checking yourselves to settle the matter! (Remembering of course to use an octal calculator which displays to the right of the octal point).\n\nI've found a number which is satisfies conditions similar to those for 381654729 but with a more orderly progression of digits:\n\n\n111111 is divisible by 1, and 111111222222 by 2, 111111222222333333 by 3, 111111222222333333444444 by 4 all the way up to that number above, which is divisible by 9.\n\nMoreover the divisors can also consist of six digits: 111111222222 is divisible by 222222; 111111222222333333 by 333333 and so on.\n\nSo far I've only got this to work with a dividend consisting of each digit repeated six times, and divisors consisting of either one or six repeated digits.\n\n(PS I sent this direct to James Grime as well, who said it was nice. The highest compliment)\n\nChris G\n\nHow can 1234 is divisible by 4\n\nAnd if u r trying to use 1111222233334444 then\nWe can use every digit once only\n\nB=8, D=6, E=5, F=4, H=2\n\n1.

A and C= 7 and 9; G=3; I=1\n\n\nThese 8 numbers satisfy all the conditions except for divisibility by 7.\nIs there a way to get the correct answer without checking each number individually?\n\nYes, it's very interesting how 7 is so often the one problem non-divisor when all the others fit neatly in. I also encountered that in the course of building up to that remarkable number in my previous post. (I'm not bragging, the number's remarkable, not me). For example\n\n\nworks for each digit except 7 or 777. Damn! It's only when I got up to groups of six repdigits that 7 finally toed the line along with all the others and divided in where it should. Yet golly, when it does divide it does so in spades.\n\nLook at that number again:\n\n\nEach individual repdigit group of six is divisible by 7. Not only that, each successive group of groups is as well. For example 111111222222 is, and 111111222222333333, and so on.\n\nI'm not going any further for now. After six digits I shall rest with the seventh.\n\nChris G\n\nis there any number which satisfies every condition???\n\nThere are three sequences that aren't divisible by their last digit: 1234 isn't divisible by 4, 1234567 by 7, or 12345678 by 8. Either replace the last digit in each case with 2, or add 2, and the situation is rectified.\n\nWhat about the reverse of the 1-9 sequence? 987654321 is divisible by 9, 98765432 by 8, 987654 by 6, 98765 by 5, 9876 by 4, 987 by 3, 98 by 2, 9 by 1. This time only 7 is the snag (as usual) since 9876543 isn't divisible by 7, so we have to add 2 again.\n\nWhat about dividing the reverse by the last digit? 9 is divisible by 9, 98 isn't divisible by 8, ah but 987 is actually divisible by 7, and the others going downwards are also divisible by their last digit except 987654 isn't divisible by 4. So this time subtract 2 from the odd ones out.\n\nChris G\n\nnow try it in hex ;)\n\n\nThis number by dividing as mentioned in question without repetition works...plzz check"}

Then it follows from\u00a0rearranging and inserting into\u00a0the second equation that\u00a0 . So p is the difference of two cubes. \u00a0This difference can be written as\n\nSince we have the factor y-x in from of the larger equation, it is obvious that p must be divisible by y-x and therefore p can only be prime if y-x = 1.

{"problem": "Are [\u0259] and [\u028c] distinct phonemes or allophones of a single phoneme in American English, and what evidence supports this classification?", "final_answer": "[\u0259] and [\u028c] are allophones of a single phoneme.", "raw_text": "Retrieved from https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/19851/american-english-are-%C9%99-and-%CA%8C-different-phonemes-schwa-vs-chevron\nWhat case can be made for considering whether [\u0259] and [\u028c] are different phonemes or not in American English? Please note the focus is on standard American English. EDIT: i.e.: on General American.\n\nMany dictionaries use /\u028c/ in stressed position and /\u0259/ in unstressed positions. So we get transcriptions such as:\n\n  \u2022 DUST /d\u028cst/\n  \u2022 LOVE /l\u028cv/\n  \u2022 BACKUP /\u02c8b\u00e6k\u02cc\u028cp/\n  \u2022 KETCHUP /\u02c8k\u025bt\u0283.\u0259p/\n  \u2022 CUSTOM /\u02c8k\u028cs\u00b7t\u0259m/\n\nHowever, if these truly constitute two different phonemes, then we should be able to come up with minimal pairs to illustrate the contrast between both sounds.\n\nI cannot think of a single minimal pair to contrast /\u0259/ and /\u028c/.\n\nIt's interesting to look at CMU Dictionary, the pronouncing dictionary of American English.\n\nCMU Dictionary uses AH for both sounds. So we get:\n\n  \u2022 DUST D AH1 S T\n  \u2022 LOVE L AH1 V\n\n(0 = unstressed, 1 = primary stress, 2 = secondary stress)\n\nMy understanding is that, provided the stressed syllables are pronounced longer and with more energy, saying BACKUP, KETCHUP and CUSTOM as [\u02c8b\u00e6k\u02cc\u0259p], [\u02c8k\u0259t\u0283.\u0259p] and [\u02c8k\u0259s\u00b7t\u0259m] would not hinder comprehension in the least.\n\nAs I see it, there's only one phoneme here, which happens to be realized [\u028c] in stressed position and as a schwa [\u0259] in unstressed positions.\n\nThis leaves us with two problems:\n\n  \u2022 Problem 1\u00a0: if /\u0259/ and /\u028c/ are different phonemes, what are some examples of minimal pairs between the two?\n\n  \u2022 Problem 2\u00a0: if they are allophones, which notation should be used for the phoneme? I assume /\u0259/.\n\nThe reason I'm asking is because I'm teaching American English with a lot of phonemic transcriptions \u2013 why teach two phonemes when there's only one.\n\nFinally, where would professional linguists locate those sounds on the following chart (again, from an American point of view)?\n\n\nThe only discussion of the topic I found online so far is on this forum. There's also, to some extent, the Talk section about the ARPAbet article on Wikipedia.\n\nEDIT (DEC 2018): FYI, I was asking the question in the context of designing an IPA chart for American English (General American), to teach phonetics and ESL, which implies deciding just which phones to teach -- and why.\n\n  \u2022 7\n    You have some wrong assumptions in your post. 1. \"if these truly constitute two different phonemes, then we should be able to come up with minimal pairs\" - Not necessarily. There are phonemes with limited distribution (e.g. h, \u014b). etc. 2. As Giegerich 1992 correctly observes, \"taking stress into account, schwa is in complementary distribution with all other vowels (except [\u026a])\" and thus, he concludes, we are not entitled to call schwa an English phoneme. \u2013\u00a0Alex B. Oct 1 '16 at 17:54\n  \u2022 6\n    3. That there's a single \"American English\"--the United States is about as large as Europe. \u2013\u00a0chrylis -cautiouslyoptimistic- Oct 2 '16 at 2:34\n  \u2022 The Wikipedia article dedicated to English phonology states \"[\u028c] (stressed) and [\u0259] (unstressed) may be considered allophones of a single phoneme in General American\", citing John Wells' Accents of English pp. 121, 132 (but unclear in which of the three volumes.) If I can get my hands on the book, I'll post an update and quote what I've found. \u2013\u00a0Fabien Snauwaert Apr 4 '19 at 16:19\n\nThis is a well-written argument, but I think it's mistaken to conclude that they are the same phoneme; or, more to the point, I think this is a case that highlights a limit of phoneme/allophone analysis.\n\nIndeed, the same argument can also be used to show that /\u0259/ and /\u028a/ are allophones of the same phoneme: there cannot be a minimal pair because of the restriction of the stress patterns on the syllables they occur in. But then there is a problem, since there are plenty of minimal pairs distinguishing /\u028c/ and /\u028a/ (e.g. put/putt).\n\n(One possible solution to this problem, rather than introducing /\u0259/ as a phoneme, would be to argue that /\u0259/ is perceptually closer to /\u028c/ than to /\u028a/, which does not match my personal intuition but seems closer to what other native English speakers tend to think.)\n\n  \u2022 3\n    I don't see a problem here. Can't you just say that [\u0259] is the unstressed allophone of both /\u028c/ and /\u028a/? Neutralization is hardly an unusual phenomenon, especially in this context. \u2013\u00a0user54748 Oct 1 '16 at 22:11\n  \u2022 2\n    @user54748 i guess the point is that \"x and y are allophones of the same phoneme\" sounds like an equivalence relation, but it's not, since x ~ y and y ~ z does not imply x ~ z. \u2013\u00a0hunter Oct 20 '16 at 21:19\n  \u2022 1\n    As a non-native, I have trouble distinguishing /\u0259/ and /\u028c/ in the first place \u2013 not the canonical IPA unrounded [\u0254], that one's fine; but the way /\u028c/ is realized in American English, specifically, sounds to my barbarian ears super \"the same thing\"-y as [\u0259]. \u2013\u00a0melissa_boiko Jun 15 '18 at 7:31\n  \u2022 1\n    @melboiko yes, quite. [\u028c] is not a good fit for English/American /\u028c/. It's rather a spelling/transcription convention. But for most speakers it seems to be lower than /\u0259/ and a bit retracted in America. \u2013\u00a0tobiornottobi Dec 20 '18 at 20:59\n\n[\u0259] and [\u028c] are allophones of a single phoneme. Schwa appears in an unstressed syllable and wedge appears in a stressed syllable. Because of this complementarity, it is not possible to find minimal pairs distinguishing the vowel. However, the analysis has to be performed on phonetic transcriptions and not an assumed phonemic reduction of the phonetics, thus the pair [\u02ccs\u028cb\u02c8v\u0279\u0329\u0292n\u0329] (sub-version) and [s\u0259b\u02c8v\u0279\u0329\u0292n\u0329] (subversion) is not a minimal pair, because the initial syllables differ in stress.\n\nAn alternative would be to claim that stress is phonetically predictable, but is sensitive to whether or not the vowel in question is schwa (schwa cannot be stressed). Minimal pairs like the noun / verb contrast \"pervert\" [\u02c8p\u0279\u0329v\u0279\u0329t] / [p\u0279\u0329\u02c8v\u0279\u0329t] establish that stress is not phonetically predictable in English (a point that is well-known).\n\nThe logic of phonemic analysis alone does not dictate that schwa and wedge must be reduced to a single phoneme, it says that they may. This is a classic problem of phonemic analysis discussed in the classic paper \"The non-uniqueness of phonemic solutions of phonetic systems\" by Y.R. Chao. If you add to the theory an Occam's Razor compulsion to minimize the size of the phonemic inventory (which was also done), then you must reduce these two phones to one phoneme. Since in phonemic analysis, phonemes are classifications of diverse sets of phones, it is a category error to think that phonemes have phonetic properties. It is however reasonable to wonder what would be a convenient way to write that phoneme: I personally like schwa, but there is nothing wrong with wedge as a letter. More languages use schwa as an official letter that use wedge, if that matters.\n\nYour logic chart does replicate the flow of thought used in popular accounts of the concept phoneme. Phoneme choice does not \"change meaning\" (if you think about what \"change\" means, that should be clear), and failure to \"change meaning\" does not mean that the sounds are in free variation. The minimal pair test is an absolute test for phonemic status: if [a] and [b] appear in the same phonetic substitution frame ([b\u026ap] \"horse\" vs [b\u026ab] \"arrow\") then the sounds are instantly proven to be distinct phonemes. If there are no such pairs, it is still possible that they can be reduced to a single underlying phoneme. The crucial question is whether some set of rules can be posited to derive the phonetic outputs: if not, then the two sounds cannot be distinguished purely by rule, and there must be two phonemes.\n\nFree variation, on the other hand, refers to the situation where the same word can be pronounced in two different ways, and there is no linguistic distinction between the pronunciations (one may find social distinctions, such as whether the pronunciation [\u00f0] is in a more informal register compared to [d] (in Palauan). The key is that free variation is defined in terms of \"same word\", not \"changing meaning\". Different words, of course, often have different meanings, but not always (sofa, couch).\n\n  \u2022 4\n    Just to be clear, by the same argument [\u0259] is also an allophone of most other English vowels, correct? If so, it seems to me we would not want to call the underlying phoneme /\u0259/. \u2013\u00a0TKR Oct 8 '16 at 16:41\n  \u2022 The standard understanding of \"allophone\" is that phonemes and allophones are in a biunique relation. Neutralization of unstressed vowels is not context-free, for example the unstressed initial vowel of \"exact\" is [\u025b], not [\u0259]. So there is a non-allophonic rule neutralizing short unstressed vowels in open syllables to something central (wedge is an underlying vowel of English), and then an allophonic rule saying that the vowel is [\u0259] if it is unstressed. \"Underlying\" and \"phoneme\" are not the same thing, just in case one has neutralization. \u2013\u00a0user6726 Oct 8 '16 at 16:52\n  \u2022 1\n    I'm still missing something, or more than one thing. 1. By \"biunique\" do you mean that the same phone can't be an allophone of more than one phoneme? Isn't that simply neutralization (e.g. both /d/ and /t/ having [\u027e] as an allophone)? 2. If the non-allophonic rule only affects unstressed vowels in the first place, how can you have an allophonic rule \"saying that the vowel is [\u0259] if it is unstressed\"? (I also don't understand your last sentence, but maybe that's a topic for a separate question.) \u2013\u00a0TKR Oct 8 '16 at 17:24\n  \u2022 Yes, each phone translates to a single phoneme: that's the classical definition, and neutralization is the problem. Some people understand \"phoneme\" to mean \"underlying sound\", which is different, so this is a YMMV matter, and a reason why one should avoid unclear terms like \"phoneme\". As for 2, not every unstressed vowel becomes wedge as I explained; but every unstressed wedge becomes schwa. But it crucially has to be unstressed, so you can't say \"every wedge becomes schwa\". The allophonic rule does not only apply to the output of full-to-wedge reduction: they are separate rules. \u2013\u00a0user6726 Oct 8 '16 at 17:29\n  \u2022 1\n    Why would one retain the concept \"phoneme\" at all? We have the concept \"segment\": what does \"phoneme\" buy you? I didn't say that \u028c\u2192\u0259 doesn;t apply to the output of V\u2192\u028c: that is why \"only\" is there. But these are separate questions. \u2013\u00a0user6726 Oct 8 '16 at 17:42\n\nFor a minimal pair to contrast /\u0259/ and /\u028c/, how about: \"subversion\" meaning an act of subverting, and \"subversion\" as in version 1 subversion 1.2.\n\n  \u2022 4\n    That's just a stress contrast. The point is whether stressed schwa contrasts with unstressed schwa, or whether stress defines complementary distribution. This is a theoretical argument, since phoneme and allophone are terms in particular theories -- and may well have different meanings in different theories. \u2013\u00a0jlawler Oct 1 '16 at 16:37\n  \u2022 1\n    @jlawler, it is indeed \"just\" a stress contrast. But that's what the question is about -- whether there is a contrast between the unstressed phone [\u0259] and the stressed phone [\u028c]. Rosie's example shows that there is. It works fine for me. \u2013\u00a0Greg Lee Oct 2 '16 at 12:42\n  \u2022 @Greg Lee, the stress contrast is in the first syllable 'sub', not the schwa[s] in 'version'. \u2013\u00a0amI Oct 12 '16 at 18:56\n  \u2022 @amI, that's true. Did you think I implied something different? \u2013\u00a0Greg Lee Oct 12 '16 at 20:13\n  \u2022 @Greg Lee, yes -- You said that the test is to find a contrast between the phones in question, so finding a stress contrast of a different phoneme in a different syllable does not satisfy the test. \u2013\u00a0amI Oct 14 '16 at 18:38\n\nYour question doesn't really have an answer.\n\nFor me, there is a contrast between the weak form of just meaning recently, /d\u0292\u0259st/, and the word just meaning fair, /d\u0292\u028cst/.\n\nI use the weak form of just almost all the time, and the vowel is definitely different from the one I use in just, meaning fair.\n\nSo I perceive them as different phonemes. But many Americans pronounce them exactly the same, and these Americans would probably perceive them as the same phoneme.\n\n  \u2022 I completely understand that it is far more common to stress just 'fair' than just 'recently' but imagine you are annoyed that someone has repeatedly told you to close the window and you say: I've JUST done that! Here you have the strong form. \u2013\u00a0tobiornottobi Dec 20 '18 at 21:28\n  \u2022 I never use a schwa in just \"fair\", even when it doesn't have much stress on it. And I use a schwa in just \"recently\" even when it has a moderate amount of stress on it. (Maybe not in I've JUST done that, but in phrases like hold on just a minute.) And the two vowels are definitely different. In fact I can use either the strong form or the weak form in hold on just a minute. The distinction between these is not the stress, but the vowels. \u2013\u00a0Peter Shor Dec 21 '18 at 16:18\n  \u2022 I agree with this. Even when very emphatically stressed, just \u2018recently\u2019 and but both have schwa, never wedge; and even when unstressed, just \u2018fair\u2019 and butt always have schwa, never wedge. I cannot think of any way to reconcile that with them being a single phoneme. \u2013\u00a0Janus Bahs Jacquet Apr 30 '20 at 5:30\n\nStress is phonemic in English, so of course [\u0259] and [\u028c] are different phonemes, since only the latter is stressed.\n\n  \u2022 9\n    Why not just consider [\u028c] a stressed allophone of /\u0259/? Any contrast can be assigned to conditioning by stress, which is, as noted, phonemic, and is expected to condition vowels. \u2013\u00a0jlawler Oct 1 '16 at 15:00\n  \u2022 3\n    That fact makes them more likely to be allophones, since it suggests that they are in complementary distribution. \u2013\u00a0anomaly Oct 1 '16 at 15:21\n  \u2022 4\n    @jlawler, There are several vowels which alternate with [\u0259]. You wouldn't be able to predict what vowel quality would result when /\u0259/ gets stressed. \u2013\u00a0Greg Lee Oct 1 '16 at 15:56\n  \u2022 2\n    I'm still having trouble understanding. I thought stress was suprasegmental, but you seem to be saying here it is a feature of the vowel phoneme. If unstressed and stressed /\u028c/ are different phonemes, and so on for any stressed-unstressed pair of vowels, doesn't that effectively double the phonemic inventory of English? \u2013\u00a0brass tacks Oct 1 '16 at 17:22\n  \u2022 2\n    The strongest argument for schwa not being the same phoneme as /\u028c/ is still this comment by @chrylis: \"schwa is in complementary distribution with all other vowels (except [\u026a])\", which I take to mean that all vocalic phonemes, exception noted, turn into schwa when unstressed (which probably originates the widespread joke that English is spoken with a hot potato in mouth). If so, schwa cannot be the same phoneme as /\u028c/, but must be an allophone for every other English vowel. \u2013\u00a0Lu\u00eds Henrique Oct 3 '16 at 13:49\n\nI don't know about American English but in standard English there is a minimal pair:\n\n'Bacup' (a town in Lancashire) /beik\u0259p/ and 'Bake up' /beik \u028cp/, however the stress issue may still apply.\n\n  \u2022 Standard English? \u2013\u00a0Azor Ahai -him- Oct 8 '16 at 18:22\n  \u2022 1\n    Yes - as spoken by the English in England \u2013\u00a0Ned Oct 10 '16 at 9:45\n  \u2022 6\n    Then you should clarify that's what you mean. \u2013\u00a0Azor Ahai -him- Oct 10 '16 at 16:26\n  \u2022 English \u201cas spoken by the English is England\u201d is not \u201cstandard English\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s British English, or more specifically English English (though it sounds daft). And it\u2019s certainly not just one English. \u2013\u00a0Janus Bahs Jacquet Apr 30 '20 at 5:33\n\nThis is just my observation but it's in favor of this hypothesis. In songs for example where the meter clashes with the natural stress of a word containing a schwa, I have observed that the stressed schwa becomes /\u028c/, even when the spelling of the specific word does not indicate that there ever was a /\u028c/ in this position. (Maybe I'll be able to recall an example later.)\n\nIn addition to that I would call the articulation of /\u028c/ the most similar to /\u0259/ from all English phonemes.\n\n\nTo me, the schwa is similar to the Turkish dotless i. A vowel close to no real differentiation, and with that imo a shorter and less pronounced version of ir as in birth. Once a vowel is pronounced in a very 'flat' way and it gets short (as when there is less stress on it), we get the schwa - with the above mentioned exception /\u026a/.\n\nThe word custom is actually a good way to show the difference. If we replace the schwa with an /\u028c/, we get something like custum (let's put stress on both syllables for clarity, but with a little bit of trying, one should be able to just stress the first syllable and still get the u-sound, not the schwa, in the unstressed syllable).\n\nThe u in backup is also a good example. If we pronounce it the same as back up (trying to stress both words, for clarity again), we should hear a difference to the American way of saying backup (trying to stress the up but keep the pronunciation 'flat').\n\nIn both words, we can try to stretch out the schwa or the /\u028c/, and we will hear a sound similar to ir in birth and a in car, respectively.\n\nAmerican English tends to 'flatten' the different vowels, so a lot of vowels could probably be replaced with the schwa. I'd leave it in the current way in IPA, because a lot of people do actually have a hint of the vowel in the pronunciation, with the phoneme chosen according to the usual rules or regional variation.\n\nWhere it's rare to pronounce the vowel clearly, one might also choose the second most popular pronunciation in the region or in important dialects (British and American English, in the future probably also Indian English), with some indicator that people often 'flatten' it to a schwa.\n\nOne might also consider that pronunciation is often not only affected by the spelling of a word, but also the way dictionaries say they are supposed to pronounce it. Putting a schwa everywhere would probably not help people pronounce things so that an English speaker from another country can understand them. While having a 'real' vowel there would give people a 'standard pronunciation' for when trying to talk especially clear, for instance to a foreigner.\n\n  \u2022 The thing with the dictionary is\u2026 While many a dictionary differentiate between schwa or chevron, others do not. Some that consider them a merger: The Kindle's dictionary (The New Oxford American Dictionary, e.g.: \u201csomeone\u201d = /\u02c8s\u0259m\u02ccw\u0259n/); dictionary.com (e.g.: suhm-wuhn); and aforementioned CMU, used extensively in applied linguistics. There seems to be an American preference in favor of the merger and a British tradition (\"a schwa is never stressed!\") in favor of a split\u2026 though my question is specifically about American English. \u2013\u00a0Fabien Snauwaert Apr 10 '19 at 22:07\n\nYour Answer"}

Can a question about storing injective maps in a neural network be translated to a question about the VC-dimension of a neural network?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m interested in something like the following result\n\nThere are 60 functions, note that we can represent this with 6 bits The codomain consists of 5 elements, which can be encoded by 3 bits (since 5 < 2^3) We need to map 3 elements of the domain to an element of the co-domain, so we need 3 times 3 bits for each function So to encode 60 functions we need 60 * 3 * 3 bits\n\nIn general we need (N! / (N-k)! ) * k * log_2(N) bits Note that (N-k+1)^k < N! / (N-k)! < N^k and even (N-k)^k < (N! / (N-k)! ) * k * log_2(N) < N^k\n\nOne weight in a neural network is 32 bits If we have X weights, then we have X*32 bits\n\nSo if X*32 is smaller than log_2(N-k) * k, then it\u2019s not possible to express all the functions in the network [I\u2019m actually more interested in negative results like the one I gave, sorry if that\u2019s confusing. Positive results are welcome as well.]\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I'm not sure what your question is.

Or, at least, you probably won't get a tight analysis. There are theorems showing that neural networks are universal approximators, meaning that given sufficient capacity it is possible to express every function, but this doesn't tell you the minimize size needed to express every function; it just tells you that there exists a size that is large enough.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to accept empirical evidence rather than theorems and proofs, research has demonstrated empirically that if you choose a deep neural network architecture with sufficient capacity and you train for long enough, neural nets can memorize the training set and achieve 100% accuracy on the training set, at least for a randomly chosen function $f$ [1]. This may not tell you exactly what size neural network you need to ensure that it can express all such functions, and it's not a proof or a guarantee.\n\nThe VC dimension is beautiful theory but it's not clear it has a great deal of relevance to modern use of neural networks in practice.\n\n[1] Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization.

{"problem": "Efficiently extract the binary digits of the fractional part of a matrix of machine precision numbers", "final_answer": "Use the digit3 method: Mod[IntegerPart[x 2.^k], 2]", "raw_text": "Retrieved from https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/189878/extracting-binary-digits-of-machine-precision-numbers\nCurrently, I am developing an octree data structure. And I need it to be fast. To this end, I would like to have a fast way to extract the $m$ binary digits \"after the dot\" of each entry in a matrix of machine precision numbers. This matrix is of size $n \\times d$ where $d$ is the space dimension (say $d=3$) and represents a set of $n$ points (shift and rescaled to lie in the unit box) to which the octree has to adapt. The number $n$ is typically in the range of a couple of 100 thousands and a few million. So, the input parameters are, e.g.,\n\nn = 1000000;\nd = 3;\nm = 32;\nx = RandomReal[{0., 1. - $MachineEpsilon}, {n, d}];\n\nFor performance, it is crucial that the resulting $n \\times d \\times m$ tensor is a packed array of Integers.

But in view of the fact that actually nothing has to be computed as the mantissas of the machine precision numbers are actually stored in binary, the timings are really disappointing.\n\nToPack = Developer`ToPackedArray;\ncf = Compile[{{z0, _Integer}, {base, _Integer}, {n, _Integer}},\n   IntegerDigits[z0, base, n],\n   CompilationTarget -> \"C\",\n   RuntimeAttributes -> {Listable},\n   Parallelization -> True,\n   RuntimeOptions -> \"Speed\"\n\ndigits1 = ToPack[RealDigits[x, 2, m, -1][[All, All, 1]]]; // \n  AbsoluteTiming // First\ndigits2 = ToPack[IntegerDigits[IntegerPart[x 2.^m], 2, m]]; // \n  AbsoluteTiming // First\ndigits3 = Transpose[Table[Mod[IntegerPart[x 2.^k], 2], {k, 1, m}], {3, 1, 2}]; // \n  AbsoluteTiming // First\ndigits4 = Transpose[cf[IntegerPart[x 2.^m], 2, m], {1, 2, 3}]; // \n  AbsoluteTiming // First\n\ndigits1 == digits2 == digits3 == digits4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have also tried to use BitGet but that was a couple of times slower than RealDigits.\n\nIn practice, I do not know in advance how many digits I need. So it would be even better to retrieve only the $k$-th digit at a time. In this case, the timings look as follows:\n\nk = 4;\ndigit1 = ToPack[RealDigits[x, 2, 1, -k][[All, All, 1, -1]]]; // \n  AbsoluteTiming // First\ndigit2 = ToPack[\n     IntegerDigits[IntegerPart[x 2.^k], 2, 1][[All, All, -1]]]; // \n  AbsoluteTiming // First\ndigit3 = Mod[IntegerPart[x 2.^k], 2]; // AbsoluteTiming // First\ndigit4 = cf[IntegerPart[x 2.^k], 2, 1][[All, All, -1]]; // \n  AbsoluteTiming // First\n\ndigit1 == digit2 == digit3 == digit4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Mod and IntegerPart seem to do quite a good job, but still, there is a multiplication involved for each digit to be extracted.\n\nDoes anybody know of a fast, low-level way to retrieve the digits?\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ What I'd try for raw speed is write a C plugin where you cast the double into an unsigned long long int and extract the bits directly by masking, using info from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754 $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Roman Jan 20 '19 at 20:40\n  \u2022 1\n    $\\begingroup$ Correction: I've written a minimalistic C plugin that extracts a single binary digit directly by bit masking a uint64_t version of the double number.

Feb 12, 2004 #2\n\n\n    User Avatar\n    Science Advisor\n\n    The first step in generalizing a statement is to be sure you understand what is said. It is not just the case that \" it's possible to obtain lots of different weights\". The point is that it is possible to obtain every integer from 1 to 121 oz. Did you notice that 1+ 3+ 9+ 27+ 81= 121? Did you notice that 1, 3, 9, 27, and 81 are all powers of 3? How would you use those weights to weigh something that weighed 2 oz? 4 oz?\n\n    The second step is trying other special cases. What could you weigh if you had weights of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 (powers of 2)? What about 1, 4, 16, 64, 256 (powers of 4)? Powers of 5?\n  4.

Jun 30, 2004 #4\n    If we have two weights we need only to use one side of the scale. In base 2, we just write 1 or 0. So the max for 5 weights, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 in base two will be written 11111, which is equal to 2^5-1 =31 in its extent. The base 4 as noted will not work because we can not write 2, since we have 1, 4, 16....\n\n    In base three, everything is written as 0,1,2. But we have no two in our weights, but we can use both sides of the scale. Example:\n\n    Take 210 base 3 = 2x9+1x3 = 21 base 10. We do not have the 2, but we can replace it with -1 (putting it on the other side of the scale) and \"bump up\" the digits like we would in base 10, getting not 210 base 3, but 1(-1)10 base 3 = 27-9+3 =21 base 10.\n\n    Now, 10211 can be bumbed up to 11(-1)11. But the number 10211 = 103 base 10 is less than 11111=121 base 10, and this situation will always happen since 02 =2 is less than 11 =4 base 10.\n\n    The problem is limited by the fact that can not \"bumb up\" on weight 81 because that is the highest of the weights, and so after 11111 base 3, we can go no higher because a 2 anywhere would require a 6th weight. So the max is 11111 = (3^5-1)/(3-1) = 121 base 3."}
