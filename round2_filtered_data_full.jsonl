A piece of fudge costs 4 \ncents, gumdrops are 4 for a penny, and chocolate drops are 2 for a \npenny. If he bought all these varieties, how many of each did he buy? \nHere is the solution one of my students came up with:\n\n1)  4f + g/4 + c/2 = 20     multiply everything by 4\n\n2) 16f + g   + 2c  = 80\n3)   f + g   +  c  =  2     subtract line 3 from line 2\n4) 15f       +  c  = 60\n\n5) Since 15f is a multiple of 15, 15f can only be 15, 30, or 45, from \n   f = 1, 2, or 3 respectively.\n\n6) If f = 1, then there are 45 chocolate drops; that's too many\n7) If f = 2, then there are 30 chocolate drops; that's too many\n8) If f = 3, then there are 15 chocolate drops; that's good\n\n9) So we have 3 fudge and 15 chocolate drops, so we have 2 gumdrops, \n   which works out to 3 fudge = 12 cents; 15 chocolate drops = \n   7.5 cents; and 2 gumdrops = .5 cents; that does work.\n\nThe question the class has, which I can't explain, is that when we \nsubtract line 3 from line 2, it looks as if we are subtracting the \nnumber of items from the cost of the items. How can we subtract when \nwe are looking at different units?\n\nDate: 05/26/2001 at 23:31:08\nFrom: Doctor Peterson\nSubject: Re: Subtracting units of different types\n\nHi, Bruce (and class!)\n\nInteresting question. I have two ways to look at it.\n\nFirst, in my mind when I write an equation it is abstract, and doesn't \ninvolve units. I hide the units in the definitions of the variables \n(for example, by saying \"x is the length in meters,\" so that x itself \nis merely a number); in this case, \"f is the number of pieces of \nfudge,\" and f is just a number, which becomes a number of pieces of \nfudge only when I apply my solution back to the actual problem. When \nyou write the equation for cost, you are initially thinking of units,\n\n     4 cents/piece * f pieces + 1/4 cent/piece * g pieces\n     + 1/2 cent per piece * c pieces = 20 cents\n\nbut then you drop the units (dividing the whole equation by \"cents\") \nto get merely:\n\n     4f + g/4 + c/2 = 20\n\nNow when you do the algebra, you can ignore units; the algebra doesn't \n\nSecond, I have to admit there are times when I do like to think of an \nequation as having units, so that I can check, for instance, that \nevery term represents an area, and I am not trying to add areas and \nlengths, which would indicate I made an error. If I want to do that \nhere, I will have to say that equation (2) is in cents, while \nequation (3) is in pieces, and in order to subtract the latter I have \nto multiply it by the unit fraction \"cents/piece\" (just as I might \nhave had to multiply it by 2 before subtracting) so that the units as \nwell as the numbers match and I can really subtract like terms. I \nwouldn't bother with that sort of thinking here, but it might be worth \n\nMaybe there's a third way to think this out. Often equations like \nthese can be solved concretely, as I have to do in solving this sort \nof problem with a student who hasn't had any algebra. That is, rather \nthan work with variables, I would manipulate the actual objects, \nexchanging them, moving them to the other side of a scale, and so on. \nWe would say in this case, first suppose Tommy bought four times as \nmuch of everything; then he would have spent 80 cents. (This gives \nequation 2.) Now suppose I pay him a penny for each item, regardless \nof its type (subtracting equation 3 from equation 2)... I'm not sure \nhow I would finish this, but you might like to try it and see what \nconcrete explanation you could give for that step. That would explain \nwhere the units go, and I suspect you will find it matches one of my \nanswers above.\n\n- Doctor Peterson, The Math Forum\n\nDate: 05/27/2001 at 11:16:36\nFrom: (Anonymous)\nSubject: Re: Subtracting units of different types\n\nHow would that last work?  \n\n        16f + g + 2c = 80\n     -     f + g + c = 20\n\nIf each variable in the latter equation, as you suggest, is a penny, \nthen how can you take away 20? Shouldn't you be taking away 3?\n\nDate: 05/28/2001 at 22:56:53\nFrom: Doctor Peterson\nSubject: Re: Subtracting units of different types\n\nHi, Bruce.\n\nActually, this part doesn't make any sense to me either; it was late, \nI just had this idea that _some_ concrete solution might help explain \nwhat's going on, but I couldn't come up with a good solution along \nthose lines, so I just left you with a suggestion of the kind of thing \nI had in mind, hoping you might be able to finish it, or that I would \ndream up such a solution. Let's think it through now.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of would be a concrete solution to \nsomething simpler, like:\n\n    I bought 8 items, some for 5 cents and some for 2 cents, and\n    they cost a total of 25 cents. What did I buy?\n\nAlgebraically, this becomes\n\n      x + y = 8    (items)\n    5x + 2y = 25   (cents)\n\nand we subtract twice the first from the second to get\n\n    3x = 9\n     x = 3\n\n     y = 8 - x = 5\n\nTo solve this without algebra, I would probably use an exchange \nmethod, like this:\n\n    If all 8 items cost 2 cents, the total would be only 16 cents. I\n    have to add 9 cents to that. If I replace one 2-cent item with a\n    5-cent item, I have the same number of items but add 3 cents to\n    the cost. In order to add 9 cents, I have to do this 3 times; so\n    I will have 3 5-cent items and 5 2-cent items.\n\nAlgebraically, this is equivalent to substitution:\n\n              y = 8 - x\n  5x + 2(8 - x) = 25\n        16 + 3x = 25\n             3x = 9\n              x = 3\n\nThe step that is equivalent to your addition of \"counts and costs\" is \nthe substitution; but doing it this way, there's no unit conflict; I'm \nsimply multiplying 2 cents/item by 8-x items. I think this suggests \nthat what we're really doing when we subtract equations is multiplying \nthe first equation not just by 2, but by 2 cents/item. That agrees \nwith my second suggestion last time; but I don't think it really makes \nanything any clearer.\n\nThe fact is, combining two equations is an inherently abstract \noperation, and we're not really dealing with units at all, just \nnumbers. The substitution method is more basic and intuitive, and fits \nbetter with the use of units.\n\nI'll be interested to hear whether any of these ideas help your \nstudents at all!\n\n- Doctor Peterson, The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nHigh School Basic Algebra\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM\n\u00a9 1994-2013 The Math Forum"}
{"problem": "Can a nonzero polynomial evaluate to the zero function in a commutative ring of characteristic 0?", "final_answer": "Yes", "raw_text": "Retrieved from http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/64035/can-a-nonzero-polynomial-evaluate-to-the-zero-function-in-a-suitable-infinite-ri?answertab=votes\nText:\nSign up \u00d7\n\nI shall assume all rings to be commutative in this question. The impatient can scroll down to the \"blockquote\" to read the actual question.\n\nWhenever we have a polynomial over a ring, it defines a function from the ring to itself by evaluation. It's reasonable to ask when two different polynomials define the same function.\n\nFrom the factor theorem it follows that an $n^\\text{th}$ degree polynomial over an integral domain has at most $n$ roots. Then it's easy to show this:\n\nTheorem. Let $R$ be an infinite integral domain and let $f \\in R[X]$ such that $f(a)=0$ for all $a \\in R$, then $f = 0$.\nProof. $f$ has infinitely many roots, so it must be the zero polynomial. $\\quad\\square$\n\nFor finite rings a kind of opposite situation occurs:\n\nTheorem. For any finite ring $R$ there are polynomials over $R$ that are different but agree on all elements.\nProof. There are only finitely many functions from $R$ to itself, but $R[X]$ is infinite. $\\quad\\square$\n\nIf we make further assumptions it's of course possible to prove more, as Pete L. Clark wrote in this post: [1]\n\nThen there is the question of infinite rings that are not integral domains. It's relatively easy to come up with examples of a ring $R$ with positive characteristic and a nonzero polynomial that evaluates to the zero function, e.g.: $$ R := \\bigoplus_{n=1}^\\infty \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad f(X) := X^3-X.$$\n\nThe Question:\n\nThis leaves open the case alluded to in this post's title: Is there a commutative ring of characteristic $0$ (hence infinite) such that a nonzero polynomial evaluates to the zero function?\n\nshare|cite|improve this question\n+1 for the hint for the impatient. \u2013\u00a0 lhf Sep 13 '11 at 0:34\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nup vote 15 down vote accepted\n\nYes. I'll give my example first. Below is the TeXing I did while thinking that I was proving the answer to be \"no\". Trying to prove the answer was \"no\" led me to this example:\n\nLet $R=\\mathbb{Z}[y]/\\langle 6y,y^2\\rangle$. This commutative ring has characteristic zero, since no integer is in the ideal $\\langle 6y,y^2\\rangle$. And now you can just slide over your polynomial example so that it always evaluates to zero: $$f(X) = y\\;X^3-y\\;X=y\\;(X^3-X)$$\n\nJust as in your example, $X^3-X$ always evaluates to a multiple of $6$ when $X$ is an integer. More generally if $X=a+b\\;y$, then since $y^2$ is modded out, we only need consider the constant term $a$.\n\nIf you changed the question to be about integral domains rather than characteristic zero rings, then the answer would be \"no\" by completing the argument below.\n\nSuppose that $f$ is such a polynomial in $R[x]$ of degree $n$: $$f(x)=\\sum_{j=0}^n\\;c_j\\;x^j$$ The equations $$f(i)=0$$ for $i=0\\ldots n$ form a system of $n+1$ linear equations in the unknowns $\\{c_j\\}$. There is one clear solution to this system, where each $c_j=0$. But can there be other solutions with $c_j\\in R$?\n\nThe system can be written as $$\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 &\\cdots & 1\\\\ 1 & 2 & 4 &\\cdots & 2^n\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\ 1 & n & n^2 & \\cdots & n^n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}c_0\\\\c_1\\\\c_2\\\\\\vdots\\\\ c_n\\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\\\vdots\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe matrix on the left (which I will call $V$) is an example of a Vandermonde matrix which is invertible in $M(\\mathbb{Q})$. Now, $V$ might not have an inverse in $M(R)$, but that's not a big problem. It's still the case that in $M(R)$ there is a matrix $W$ such that $W\\;V$ is a scalar matrix $D$ with an integer $d$ running down the diagonal. You just need to rescale $V^{-1}$ by the least common multiple of the divisors that appear in $V^{-1}$. After applying $W$ to both sides, $$D \\begin{bmatrix}c_0\\\\c_1\\\\c_2\\\\\\vdots\\\\ c_n\\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\\\vdots\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nSo there is some nonzero integer $d$, such that for each $j$, we have that $d\\cdot c_j=0$.\n\nHere I realized the answer is actually \"yes\".\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nI just came back to this again, and I realised that we can take $R := \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ and $f(X) := (0,1)X^3 - (0,1)X$.

It also has the convenient property that $f(p,c)$ is a non-negative integer whenever $p$ and $c$ are.\n\nOne downside is that, for a fixed vote ratio $0 < p/c < \\infty$, $f(p,c)$ grows proportionally to the square of the total number of votes $p+c$. If you'd prefer a linearly growing function instead, you can always take the square root to get the geometric mean of $p$ and $c$:\n\n$$f^*(p,c) = \\sqrt{pc}$$\n\nAs the square root is a strictly monotone increasing function, it does not affect the relative ranking of the results: $f(p,c) > f(p',c')$ if and only if $f^*(p,c) > f^*(p',c')$. However, by the AM\u2013GM inequality, we can see that $f^*(p,c)$ can never exceed half of the total vote count $p+c$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nOne problem with using $pc$ is that there are certain $g(p, c)$ for which the maximum value isn't at $p = c$. Originally I wanted to use $\\displaystyle \\frac{2pc}{p+c}$, but then I realized that if either $p$ or $c$ is constant, $f(p, c)$ actually grows when $p$ increases past $c$ or vice versa. \u2013\u00a0 Joe Z.

{"problem": "What is causing the front-end vibration in my 2002 Trailblazer, which increases over time and is noticeable after about 5 minutes of driving, despite replacing the passenger CV shaft and rebuilding the 4WD disconnect?", "final_answer": "Driver-side wheel bearing", "raw_text": "Retrieved from http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/2668/02-trailblazer-with-front-end-vibration-which-seems-to-increase-over-time?answertab=votes\nText:\nTake the 2-minute tour \u00d7\n\nAbout a month ago my trailblazer developed this new features. When you get into the car and start driving, everything feels completely fine. Then after about 5 minutes you start noticing slight vibration (very slight, just feels like something isn't quite right). After about a 20 minute drive, the vibration is very noticeable. By that time, it almost sounds like low engine rumble, but its pitch and volume vary directly with car's speed, not engine speed. When it gets to that level, it is also easily felt in the steering wheel.\n\nThree weeks ago, I jacked the car up and noticed that there was a ton of grease spewed around passenger side CV boot. So I went through the motion, which took a while for various reasons, of replacing passenger CV shaft and while in there, also rebuilt 4WD disconnect with fresh bearings and seals. Yesterday I put the car back on the road and the vibration is still in there unchanged.\n\nI tugged on both wheels to check wheel hubs and at first glace the wheel bearings appear fine. I've had bad wheel bearings on this car before, left one is 5 years old. right one is 1 year old. Whenever wheel bearings were bad a) vibration would be constant through out the drive (i.e. you can feel it the second you start driving) and b) they would change in sound when turning left or right.\n\nThis current vibration is... 1) unaffected by turning left/right or going straight 2) does not change in sound if 4wd is engaged or disengaged 3) unaffected by putting the car in neutral and revving the engine\n\nI also checked the front differential fluid level (obviously destroying the fill plug in the process) and topped off the oil level. It was a little low, but no where near empty.\n\nAny ideas what would be causing it?\n\nUPDATE: Drove the car to work today. I have to take back (1) from above. If I turn the steering wheel right, vibration becomes stronger and if I turn left it gets weaker, which is actually consistent with driver's side wheel bearing being bad. The difference is that with my previous bad bearings, I only had to apply slight pressure to the steering wheel to hear sound difference, but this time, I have to push the steering wheel a bit further out (can still hear difference in a single lane going straight). Also the vibration this time seems to be distinctly lower pitch than the ones I've heard in the past with wheel bearings, but maybe they come in different shapes and sounds?\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n2 Answers\n\nI also have a AWD Trailblazer, and low diff oil can cause uneven gear wear (mine is perennially low because I have a leaking diff seal which the dealer can't get out). As the oil heats up, the vibration can become more prominent because the thick oil is no longer damping the vibration.\n\nYou may also want to check that your wheels are balanced. You might have chucked a wheel weight or worn a tire unevenly. But, the noise you describe (through the steering wheel) definitely sounds to me like a worn front diff.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nNick, although I appreciate a response, that is sooooo not what I wanted to hear :). Stupid TB. I did have the same suspicion, that' why I topped off the fluid, but I can't say it was that low. And btw, I did also notice that the differential pinion seal is leaking oil on my car as well. Stupid TB. \u2013\u00a0 DXM Jan 16 '12 at 20:44\nadd comment\n\nIt was driver-side wheel bearing.\n\nI've had 4 other bad wheel bearings (2 in this car, 1 in wife's BMW 330i and 1 in my old Integra) and they've always sounded the same. Smooth, mid- to high-pitch vibration which almost disappears when you turn the wheel one way or another.\n\nWhat confused me was this noise was much rougher (like I said in original question, almost low engine rumble) and at first it happened at any steering wheel angle. Past few days I did notice change in pitch/volume when moving the steering wheel but it wasn't like that at first.\n\nOne clue that told it it was probably a wheel bearing was after I came home few days ago, I felt the rims and driver side was significantly warmer than passenger side, which I would guess caused by extra friction in the bad hub.\n\nNow the car is back on the road and feels as smooth as butter.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

Thanks for a well-written question - it really helps to \nknow just what part you have trouble with.\n\nThe key to this step is that\n\n     x^-a    1           1     x^a\n     ---- = ---   and   ---- = ---\n      1     x^a         x^-a    1\n\nThat's essentially just the definition of negative exponents, and I'll \nassume you're at least aware of this as a fact. What you need is how \nto apply it.\n\nWhat these facts mean in practice is that you can move a factor from \ntop to bottom or from bottom to top and negate the exponent. Once you \nget used to it, you just think \"There's an x^-8 in the numerator, so I \ncan replace that with an x^8 in the denominator.\" To take it more \nslowly, we can pull the expression apart, apply the rule, and put it \nback together:\n\n     x^-8 y^7   x^-8   y^7    1     1     1    y^7    1     1\n     -------- = ---- * --- * --- * --- = --- * --- * --- * ---\n     y^3 x^6      1     1    y^3   x^6   x^8    1    y^3   x^6\n\n              = -----------\n                x^8 y^3 x^6\n\nThat makes all the exponents positive, but there's still another step \nyou didn't mention: combining like factors so that x and y each appear \nonly once. That's easy in the denominator now; we can just permute so \nthe x's are together and add the exponents:\n\n         y^7         y^7\n     x^8 y^3 x^6   x^14 y^3\n\nBut you still have y in two places. We can use the same rule to get \nthe y's together; since 7 > 3, let's move the y^3 to the top to keep \nthe exponents positive:\n\n       y^7      y^7    1      1    y^7    1     y^-3   y^7 y^-3   y^4\n     -------- = --- * ---- * --- = --- * ---- * ---- = -------- = ----\n     x^14 y^3    1    x^14   y^3    1    x^14     1      x^14     x^14\n\nNow we're really done.\n\nBut we've taken a lot more steps than we had to. That's fine when \nyou're starting out; this isn't a race. But here's how I'd do it \n\n     x(x^-3)^2y(xy^-2)^-3   x x^-6 y x^-3 y^6\n     (y^2)^3y^-3(x^2)^3     y^6 y^-3 x^6\n\n                          = x x^-6 y x^-3 y^6 * y^-6 y^3 x^-6\n\n                            (Here I've moved everything to the top.)\n\n                          = x x^-6 x^-3 x^-6 * y y^6 y^-6 y^3\n\n                            (Here I've gathered the x's and y's \n                             together; I'd probably mark each factor \n                             as I copied it to make sure I didn't miss \n\n                          = x^(1-6-3-6) y^(1+6-6+3)\n\n                          = x^-14 y^4\n\n                          = ----\n\nIf you're at all afraid of negative exponents, this will make you \ndizzy, but if you like to take the bull by the horns and get it over \nwith, making the negative exponents work for you, this is the way to \ndo it. Basically, I decided I'd rather deal with positive and negative \nexponents than with numerators and denominators; they're really two \nways to say the same thing, and mixing them doesn't make sense. So \neven though the goal is to have numerator and denominator and \neliminate negative exponents, I found that it's really easier to work \nwith the negatives, then change them to denominators when I'm done.\n\nIf any of this overwhelmed you, or if you have more questions, feel \nfree to write back.\n\n- Doctor Peterson, The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nHigh School Basic Algebra\nHigh School Exponents\nMiddle School Algebra\nMiddle School Exponents\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM\n\u00a9 1994-2013 The Math Forum"}

But 'key not in 2' leads to 'key in 2' (so a contradiction), as follows:\n\nBy (c), not in 2 implies in 1. By (b) then, not in 3. By (a) then, key is in 2. Contradiction.\n\nTo be safe, you can check if the game makers messed up:\n\nAs 'key in 1' is a sub chain of the above, it also leads to 'key in 2'. Contradiction.\n\nSimilarly, 'key in 3' means by uniqueness that 2 holds brass, which, by (c), implies 1 holds the key. Contradiction.\n\nFinally note that if the key is in 2, it doesn't lead to any contradictions. So game is correct.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nCell 2 cannot hold worthless brass, and cell 1 cannot have the gold key.\n\nIf a cell can have neither brass nor key, then that is the limit of what you can conclude. For example, your conditions are consistent with cell 3 having the key and there being nothing in the other cells.\n\nBut if every cell contains either brass or key, then you know cell 2 has the key. You can prove that by assuming cell 2 did not have the key, and hence had worthless brass. That implies that cell 1 has the key, which implies cell 3 has worthless brass which implies that cell 2 has the key. Contradiction.\n\nHowever, if that additional condition were part of the problem, then your middle condition would be redundant.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nSorry to be contrary, but I believe you need 2 assumptions for there to be a unique solution. First, that all 3 statements are indeed true. If we allow that one or more of those statements doesn't hold, the whole thing falls apart.\n\nSecond, that each cell contains either brass or the key. No empty cells. If you disagree, try looking at these 2 solutions:\n\nCell 1 = Empty, Cell 2 = Key, Cell 3 = Empty\n\nCell 1 = Empty, Cell 2 = Empty, Cell 3 = Key\n\nNone of the 3 statements apply to either of these, so they're both possible valid solutions and you're left to guess and hope the spiders don't eat your face.\n\nNow, you can brute force your way through by listing all possible solutions and checking which are valid under the given statements. In this case there aren't many possible choices, so that approach is not too bad. However, I'm assuming you're looking for a bit deeper insight, so I'll walk through a technique that can sometimes provide a quicker route to the answer, especially in more complex puzzles.\n\nSince all the implications are one way (they are \"if\", not \"if and only if\"), one approach is to start by assuming a condition from the left side of a statement and trace the implications through all the statements to look for inconsistencies.\n\nJust going in order, let's assume first that Cell 3 holds brass. Then by statement 1, Cell 2 holds the key. Since we're assuming key or brass in each and only one key, then Cell 1 would have to be brass. Given that, neither of the last 2 statements apply, so this solution is possible with no contradictions. Let's continue and check the others to be sure we have the only possible valid solution.\n\nLooking at statement 2, let's assume now that Cell 1 holds the key. By statement 2, Cell 3 holds brass. By statement 1, Cell 2 holds the key. Since only 1 cell can hold the key, this is a contradiction. Therefore our original assumption is false, so Cell 1 does not hold the key.\n\nLastly, look at the third statement. If we assume Cell 2 holds brass, then Cell 1 holds the key. But we already know by our last reasoning that if Cell 1 holds the key we end up with a contradiction. So our assumption here is false, and Cell 2 does not hold brass.\n\nSince Cell 2 cannot hold brass, it must hold the key.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nIf you take \"not all that is said is true\" to mean that at least one statement is false, you can go through negating them and see where it leads. If the first statement is false, you have 3 holds brass and 2 does not hold the gold key. Given that there is a gold key, it must be behind door 1. Then the second and third statements would be true, but we still don't know whether cell 2 holds brass.\n\nIf the second statement is false, cell 1 has gold and 3 does not have brass (so is empty). The first and third sentences are then true and we again know nothing about cell 2.\n\nIf the third statement is false, 2 holds brass and 1 does not have gold, so it must be cell 3 that has gold. The other two are then true and we don't know what 1 holds.\n\nSince we didn't reach a contradiction from any of these, we can't choose between them. I would downvote the puzzle creator. However, if you ignore the \"not all that is said is true\" and believe them all, gnometorule has shown how to get there.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

This terms is controled by the second derivative of the function (it clearly vanishes for a linear function) at it is bounded by $O(1/n^4)$, since the number of squares is $O(n^2)$ the estimate on this whole term is $O(1/n^2)$,\n\n  \u2022 the error term in the boundary squares, those on which the function takes both a $>0$ and a zero value.

Then the first error term can be made smaller than the second, while the second \"boundary\" error term is indeed of the order of $1/n^2$ (the boundary errors all sum up).\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThe errors in each cell tend to compensate. If instead of having a compactly supported function with limited regularity, we have a functin $F$ in the Schwartz class, then the total error is $O(n^{-k})$ for every $k>0$. This is a consequence of the Poisson summation formula and the fact that the Fourier transform of $F$ is of Schwartz class too. Therefore the question is really about the effect of the limited regularity of $F$, and whether the concavity helps. \u2013\u00a0 Denis Serre Aug 18 '11 at 16:14\nI agree but as stated the main error term comes from the boundary squares.

It seems that one would have to specify this before claiming that your $f$ is eventually decreasing. \u2013\u00a0 user83827 Dec 11 '11 at 19:56\n@ccc I suppose one would have to make the assumption that the numbering system is relatively uniform - and if no such nomenclature exists for a certain number, that the number of letters in that number would not spike by an enormous amount of digits. Perhaps one could adopt the convention of saying one million million for one million squared, for instance, so that all numbers may be accounted for. \u2013\u00a0 analysisj Dec 11 '11 at 20:01\n@ccc Do those Hebrew letters used for Cantor algebra accomplish that (naming arbitrarily large numbers)?

Given that a 1000-factor increase in the size of the number results in roughly a 28-35 letter increase in name size (\"three hundred and thirty three -illion\" and so on) it's clear that the naming convention will never catch up.

Four is the only number which has this property (that the number of letters is equal to the number itself). Therefore, we can say that if a number repeats eventually, it must repeat at 4. Furthermore, since the value of the number of letters in the number is always less than the number itself for values greater than 4, the number is always decreasing until four.\n\nSo, all that remains is to show that the numbers 3,2, and 1 always go to 4 eventually, and then we can know that it will repeat. 3 goes to 5 which goes to 4. Both 1 and 2 go to 3 which go to 5 which go to 4.

Thanks RW. \u2013\u00a0 Jesse Peterson Mar 27 '11 at 13:30\n@SIB - Yes, but the problem is still to find such a cocycle for which the resulting action is faithful - which is more or less equivalent to the original question. \u2013\u00a0 R W Mar 27 '11 at 13:40\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 6 down vote accepted\n\nThe answer is yes, such an action exists.\n\nWhat is needed for the construction is the following very nice example of an action of a non-amenable group on $\\mathbb Z$, which I just learned from Gabor Elek.\n\nConsider a graph with vertices given by $\\mathbb Z$ and unoriented edges between $n$ and $n+1$.\n\nPick a random labelling of the edges by the letters $a,b$ and $c$ with no $a$, $b$ or $c$ adjacent to the same letter. This defines an action of the group $G=\\mathbb Z/2 \\mathbb Z \\ast \\mathbb Z/2 \\mathbb Z \\ast \\mathbb Z/2 \\mathbb Z$. Indeed, just act according to existing labels or fix the element.\n\nThis action has the nice feature that it keeps invariant all counting measures on $\\mathbb Z$, i.e. all $\\mathbb Z$-Folner sequences sets are also Folner sequences for the $G$-action.\n\nNow, the space of labellings (as above) of the graph is itself a probability measure space (a Bernoulli space), which carries an ergodic p.m.p. $\\mathbb Z$-action by shifting. It is easy to see that $G$ acts on this space by measure preserving transformations (just by the method described above, done orbit by orbit) and induces an action as required. Indeed, the orbits are just the $\\mathbb Z$-orbits, so its ergodic and amenable. Faithfulness follows the fact that you considered all labellings, so that with positive probability (on the space of labellings), an element will act non-trivially. Note also that $G$ is not amenable.\n\nEDIT: As requested, more details on the action. The elements of the shift space are maps $f: \\mathbb Z \\to \\lbrace a,b,c \\rbrace$ with $f(n) \\neq f(n+1)$. A letter shifts $f$ to the right if $f(1)$ equals that letter, it shifts to the left, if $f(0)$ is equal to the letter; otherwise you fix $f$. It is obvious that the orbits are just the orbits of the shift-action of $\\mathbb Z$. Hence, the induced equivalence relation is just the one induced by the action of $\\mathbb Z$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI may miss something, but I don't see how it becomes an action. Take the sake of example the following labelling: $a$ on the edge $(0,1)$, and $b$ on all other edges $(n,n+1)$. Then, according to what you say, $a$ maps 0 to 1 and preserves all other vertices, whereas $a^{-1}$ maps 1 to 0 and preserves all other ones (I presume you meant that if you reverse orientation of an edge, then the label changes to its inverse). But then their composition is not the identity map. \u2013\u00a0 R W Mar 27 '11 at 13:37\nThanks, I corrected the construction. \u2013\u00a0 Andreas Thom Mar 27 '11 at 21:04\nI agree that now there is an action of the free product on $\\mathbb Z$. However, I still don't see how you define an action of this free product on your space of symbol sequences (your description \"just by the method described above, done orbit by orbit\" is not clear to me at all), and why this hypothetical action should be orbit equivalent to the shift. \u2013\u00a0 R W Mar 27 '11 at 22:27\nIt is really easy; I added more details above. \u2013\u00a0 Andreas Thom Mar 28 '11 at 0:15\nThat's nice - thank you. \u2013\u00a0 R W Mar 28 '11 at 3:48\n\nI believe in this paper there is an example of such group:\n\n  \u2022 Rostyslav Grigorchuk, Volodia Nekrashevych, \"Amenable actions of nonamenable groups\" (which can be downloaded from Volodia's webpage)\n\nalso, this is related (but not quite clear if one can built examples that you ask from it):\n\n  \u2022 Yair Glasner, Nicolas Monod, \"Amenable actions, free products and a fixed point property\"\nshare|improve this answer\nLet me also mention that by taking ``generic'' (think Baire category) generators one can show that the free groups have such an action. Also, by a result of Kirchberg (ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1282231), if $\\Gamma$ has property (T) and also has such an action then it must be residually finite. \u2013\u00a0 Jesse Peterson Mar 24 '11 at 12:53\n\nLet me join the discussion. Nicolas rightly says that amenability of an action is equivalent to amenability of the orbit equivalence relation and of a.e. stabilizer. It is also true that for a finite invariant measure amenability of the action is equivalent to amenability of the acting group. However, there is no contradiction here as (at least a priori) it might be possible that the orbit equivalence relation of an action of a non-amenable group is still amenable - due to the presence of huge stabilizers (which in this case must necessarily be non-amenable).\n\nI think that the paper by Grigorchuk and Nekrashevych quoted by Kate does provide a requested example. Indeed, they construct (Sections 3 and 4) a non-amenable group which has a faithful self-similar action on a homogeneous rooted tree. This action preserves the uniform measure on the boundary of the tree. Moreover, the orbit equivalence relation is a subrelation (mod 0) of the tail (or co-final in authors' terminology) equivalence relation. Since the latter one is hyperfinite ($\\equiv$ amenable), the orbit equivalence relation is also amenable.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

This theorem is known as the Erdos-Mordell \ntheorem, but it should read D >= 2*E.\n\nLet's consider the following:\n\n\nWe have that D, E and F are the feet of the perpendicular altitudes \nfrom P to AB, BC and CA respectively, while E' and F' are the feet of \nthe perpendicular altitudes from E and F to AB.\n\nCFPE is a cyclic quadrilateral because the opposite angles are \nsupplementary. PC is its diameter. We also know that the radius of the \ncircumcircle of EFC is EF/(2*sin(C)), and thus the diameter is \nEF/sin(C). This means that EF = PC*sin(C). Since EF >= E'F' this gives \n\n     PC*sin(C) >= E'F'   ........................................[1]\n\nAlso, we have \n\n     F'E' = F'D + DE' \n          = PF*cos(90-A) + PE*cos(90-B)\n          = PF*sin(A) + PE*sin(B)         .......................[2]\n\nThe combination of [1] and [2] shows that\n\n     PC * sin(C) >= PF*sin(A) + PE*sin(B)\n\n                        sin(A)       sin(B)\n              PC >= PF* ----- + PE * ----- \n                        sin(C)       sin(C)\n\nIn the same way you find similar results for PA and PB. These three \nexpressions combine to:\n     PA+PB+PC >=\n\n         sin(A)  sin(B)       sin(B)  sin(C)       sin(A)  sin(C)\n     PD*(----- + -----) + PE*(----- + -----) + PF*(----- + -----)\n         sin(B)  sin(A)       sin(C)  sin(B)       sin(C)  sin(A)\n\n              >= 2*(PD + PE + PF)\n\nbecause x + 1/x >= 2.\n\nAnd we have proven the Erdos-Mordell theorem (from 1935).

The graph of $y^2 + 5y + 5$ achieves its minimum at $y = -5/2$; therefore it is monotone on the interval $[-1/\\sqrt{3}, 1/\\sqrt{3}]$. So we can simply check the endpoints to verify that $y^2 + 5y + 5 > 1$ when $y \\in [-1/\\sqrt{3}, 1/\\sqrt{3}]$, and hence it can never equal $\\cos{x}$ if the first equation is satisfied.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

One answer is: when it is not pierced at 'the target point', there is a pressure acting on the target point (I should say area, but nevermind) on the right from the inside, as well as on its mirror point on the left, and so for every pair of points, so that the total force is zero. When you pierce the can, there still is some pressure acting on the mirror point, but there is no pressure acting on the target point, so that the total force acting on the can is not zero, and is directed to the left. (One can check that the force is the same as if you use conservation of momentum for the whole can+air system). What is pressure? Pressure is transition of momentum from air to the walls. When you pierce the target point, the momentum goes not to the can, but to the environment, and gets absorbed somewhere there.\n\nWhat changes when you pierce a vacuum can? Now the pressure acts from the outside, and now, when you pierce the can, the force on the mirror point is again not compensated and is directed to the right. So one may conclude that the can should move. But one thing is different: the momentum that was to be transfered to the target point from the outside (but was not, because there is now no surface at the target point) is not absorbed \"somewhere\", it goes inside the can, and is finally absorbed by it exactly canceling the momentum received by the mirror point.\n\nSo, in this case there is a rather subtle cancelation. However, I believe that there are some further subtleties, which may cause a small difference in these momenta, and if you try to measure the force really hard, then you will see it.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n-1 Momentum must be conserved.

Similar statements hold in other categories (differential, topological) as well.\n\nOne of the points of view on gerbes (emphasized, for example, by Hitchin in \"Lectures on special Lagrangian manifolds\") is that a gerbe can be glued from trivial gerbes just like a vector bundle can be glued from trivial vector bundles, but the gluing data is not transition functions but A-torsors. I am trying to see if this philosophy can be applied to gerbes over a spectrum of a (perfect) field $k$. Giraud's theorem tells in this case that isomorphism classes of gerbes are in bijective correspondence with elements of the Galois cohomology group $H^2(k, A)$.\n\nLet $k'/k$ be Galois with Galois group $G$ and let $A$ be an Abelian algebraic group defined over $k$ (we use $A$ to denote the corresponding Galois module). The Hochshild-Serre spectral sequence yields the following exact sequence: $$ \\ldots \\to H^2(G,A^{G_{k'}}) \\to \\mathrm{Ker}(H^2(k,A) \\to H^2(k',A)) \\to H^1(G,H^1(k',A)) \\to H^3(G,A^{G_{k'}})\\ldots $$ where $G_{k'}$ is the absolute Galois group of $k'$. Suppose we have a gerbe over $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ k$ that trivialises after base change to $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ k'$. An element of $H^1(G,H^1(k',A))$ is the gluing data that has been mentioned above (indeed, $H^1(k',A)$ classifies $A$-torsors defined over $k'$). If also the second and third cohomology of $G$ with coeffecients in $A^{G_{k'}}$ vanished then we would have an isomorphism between two middle terms of the sequence which means that any gerbe that trivialises over $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ k'$ can be described in terms of this gluing data.\n\nI have the following question: is it true that for any gerbe over $k$ one can always find a Galois extension $k'$ with Galois group $G$ such that the gerbe trivialises after base change to $k'$ and $H^2(G,A)$ and $H^3(G,A)$ vanish?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 1 down vote accepted\n\nI don't think so. I think a gerbe bound by $A$ over the spectrum of a field $k$ gives a cohomology class $\\eta\\in H^2(k,A)$, and the gerbe trivializes over an extension $k'/k$ if and only if this cohomology class trivializes. Now take $k=\\mathbb{R}$, $A=\\mathbf{G}_{m,\\mathbb{R}}$, then $H^2(k, A)={\\rm Br}(\\mathbb{R})=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{Z}/\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $\\eta\\in{\\rm Br}(\\mathbb{R})$ be the nontrivial element (corresponding to Hamilton's quaternions). Then $\\eta$ trivializes over $\\mathbb{C}$, but not over $\\mathbb{R}$, so $k'=\\mathbb{C}$, $G={\\rm Gal}(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{R})$, and $H^2(G,A)=H^2(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{R},\\mathbf{G}_m)={\\rm Br}(\\mathbb{R})\\neq 0$, so $H^2(G,A)$ does not vanish.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nindeed, the statement I hoped for is false.

Feb 1, 2009 #1\n\n    It's been god knows how long since I've had to use integration by substitution. I've totally forgotten it. I am trying to integrate to solve for the value of an electric field at a given point. The integral I am trying to solve is:\n\n    (2kz/4(pi)(epsilon_0)*1/(z^2+x^2)^(3/2) dx.\n\n    I know the answer is (2kz/4(pi)(epsilon_0)*(x/[z^2(z^2+x^2)^(1/2)]\n\n    2. Relevant equations\n\n    I'm sure I have to set u=(z^2+x^2). This makes du = 2x.\n\n    3. The attempt at a solution\n\n    I'm confused as to what to do now. The equation I'm integrating doesn't have an x in it anywhere. I don't think I can say du/2x=dx because I will have x's and u's in the integral, which is no good. However, I can't just ignore it.\n\n    Also, how did that z^2 get in there on the bottom? z is a constant in this integration and since u = z^2+x^2, the z-term drops right out. I feel terribly lost.\n  2. jcsd\n  3. Feb 1, 2009 #2\n\n\n    User Avatar\n    Science Advisor\n    Homework Helper\n\n    That's really confusing. Why don't you just post the actual problem you are working on and how you tried to solve it?\n  4. Feb 1, 2009 #3\n    Sure thing.\n\n    I'm trying to find the electric field at an arbitrary distance z above a straight line segment, where the arbitrary distance z is measured above one of the endpoints of the line segment.\n\n    Relevant Equations:\n\n    We are given that the electric field of a line charge is [tex]\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_P \\frac{\\lambda (R)}{r^2}dl[/tex].\n\n    Attempt At Solution.\n\n    A little element of the electric field is going to be pointed in two directions. One will be in the z-direction. The other will be in the direction parallel to the line. Using the geometry of the problem, I found that\n\n    [tex] dE=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0}\\frac{\\lambda dx}{r^2}(cos(\\theta) \\textbf{z}+sin(\\theta)\\textbf{x})=\\frac{\\lambda}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0}\\frac{\\lamda dx}{r^3}(z\\textbf{z}+x\\textbf{x})[/tex], where the bold indicates unit vectors.\n\n    I split this up into two integrals. This is where I have to integrate by parts, and where I get stuck. I have for instance, one integral which is [tex]\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_0^L \\frac{2 \\lambda z}{(z^2+x^2)^{3/2}}}dx[/tex].\n\n    I set my u = (z^2+x^2) and my du is then 2xdx. I am confused because there is no x in my numerator, and I can't just say du/2x=dx because then I am going to have both x's and u's in my equation when I integrate it.\n  5.

Feb 2, 2009 #5\n    Ah, I got it, I think.\n\n    If I use the u-substitution you suggest, I get [tex]du=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2+z^2}}-\\frac{x^2}{(x^2+z^2)^{3/2}}dx[/tex], which, getting a common denominator yields:\n\n\n    So [tex]\\frac{du}{z^2}=\\frac{dx}{(x^2+z^2}dx[/tex]\n\n    My integral is then just [tex]\\frac{\\lambda z}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0}\\int_a^b \\frac{du}{z^2}[/tex] which, after re-substituting for u back into x's, and plugging in the bounds 0 and L, I get\n\n    [tex] \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{\\lambda z L}{z^2(z^2+x^2)^{3/2}}[/tex].\n\n    Thanks, though I still wonder how I would have thought of that particular u-substitution on my own!\n\nHave something to add?\n\nSimilar Discussions: Integration By Substitution It's Been A While\n  1.

Please add it! \u2013\u00a0 user21436 Mar 18 '12 at 2:09\nUhm the best strategy is to try and use the pigeonhole principle? i.e. the title you gave the post.

So divide the row in sets $S_k = \\{4k + 1, 4k + 2, 4k + 3, 4k + 4\\}$ for $k = 0, \\ldots, 7$ and $S_8 = \\{33, 34, 35\\}$. For each set $S_0, \\ldots, S_7$ you need to keep one seat open, so you need at least $8$ open seats to not have a sequence of $4$ occupied seats. This maximum can also be achieved, by leaving seats open at positions $4k$, for $k = 1, \\ldots, 8$.\n\nWith respect to applying the pigeonhole principle: If you do have more than $35 - 8 = 27$ seats filled, then you have at least $25$ seats filled for $S_0, \\ldots, S_7$. Since $25 / 8 > 3$, by the pigeonhole principle one of them must have at least $4$ seats occupied. But then you get a sequence of $4$ occupied seats. So if $28$ or more seats are occupied, you always have $4$ or more consecutive occupied seats.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThere are 8 pigeonholes.We need to find the minimum pigeons so that at least one pigeon hole contains 4 pigeons.In generalized pigeon hole principle if there are n pigeons and k holes at least one pigeonhole should have $\\lceil n/k \\rceil$ pigeons.Therefore if we have $\\lceil 25/4 \\rceil$=4.So why isn't the answer=25 but 28? \u2013\u00a0 sam_rox Nov 18 '14 at 3:55\n:typo not $\\lceil 25/4 \\rceil$ but $\\lceil 25/8 \\rceil$ \u2013\u00a0 sam_rox Nov 18 '14 at 4:02\nHi Sam. The reason is that there are 35 = 4\u00d78+3 seats. You can apply the pigeonhole to the first 32 seats like you did, so you know that out of those 32 seats, it is possible to fill 24 seats. Add to that the other 3 seats, and you see it is possible to fill 27 seats. (But not 28.) \u2013\u00a0 TMM Nov 19 '14 at 17:26\n\nThis is not really an answer ........Fill the pigeonholes in blocks of 3 with 1 separator (shown as ~) 123~456~789~101112~131415~161718~192021~222324~252627 You can see that 27 is the max that can be occupied with 4 in a row.

For the proof, it is useful to let $c=x+1$. Then our expression becomes $$(x^2+3x+1)(x^2-x+1).$$ Note that $x^2-x+1$ is always odd. Any common divisor of $x^2+3x+1$ and $x^2-x+1$ must divide the difference $4x$. But such a common divisor must be odd, so any common divisor must divide $x$. But then it must divide $1$.\n\nThus $x^2+3x+1$ and $x^2-x+1$ are relatively prime. Since $x^2-x+1$ is always positive, it follows that if their product is a perfect square, each must be a perfect square.\n\nBut that can only happen when $x=0$. To prove this, use the fact that for any integer $u$, there is no perfect square strictly between $u^2$ and $(u+1)^2$. Since you asked for a hint, I will, unless you request otherwise, leave out the rest of the argument. It is short.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is sharp \u2013\u00a0 Yemon Choi Oct 8 '12 at 1:42\nWhy the down-votes? I don't think that C-S is sharp for this situation.

Here we've got far more information: the entire distribution of the random variables. \u2013\u00a0 Anthony Quas Oct 8 '12 at 3:07\nI still think, though, that the question should have included at least some examples of the kinds of distribution that the OP had in mind \u2013\u00a0 Yemon Choi Oct 8 '12 at 3:52\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nI'll assume that $X$ and $Y$ are non-negative random variables. Let $F_X$ be the cumulative distribution function of $X$ (that is $F_X(t)=\\mathbb P(X\\le t)$) and $F_Y$ be the cumulative distribution function of $Y$.\n\nIn your notation, probably $F_X(t)=\\int_0^t p(s)\\,ds$ and $F_Y(y)=\\int_0^t q(t)\\,dt$.\n\nNow define two functions on $[0,1]$: $g_X(x)=\\sup\\lbrace t\\colon \\mathbb P(X\\le t)\\le x\\rbrace $ and similarly $g_Y(x)=\\sup\\lbrace t\\colon \\mathbb P(Y\\le t)\\le x\\rbrace$. These functions are the increasing rearrangements of $X$ and $Y$. That is these are non-decreasing functions with the property that $m\\lbrace x\\colon g_X(x)\\le t\\rbrace =\\mathbb P(X\\le t)$ and $m\\lbrace x\\colon g_Y(x)\\le t\\rbrace = \\mathbb P(Y\\le t)$.\n\nNow the largest possible value of $\\mathbb E XY$ given the distributions is $\\int_0^1 g_X(t)g_Y(t)\\ dt$. Intuitively the reason for this is that the largest value for the expectation is obtained when the largest values of $X$ are multiplied by the largest values of $Y$. Slightly more precisely imagine you've arranged the $X$ values from largest to smallest. Think of these as \"weights\" for the $Y$ values. Obviously you get the biggest integral if you weight the big $Y$ values with the biggest weights.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nDear Anthony, Thank you very much for your answer! A few questions: - Is this bound better than Holder's inequality's bound \ud835\udd3c[XY] <= E[X^p]^(1/p)*E[Y^q]^(1/q) with q>1,p>1,1/p+1/q = 1? If it is, is there a way of proving or simply justifying this? - Where can I find a proof of the bound that you suggested? Thanks you Best Michele \u2013\u00a0 Michele Oct 9 '12 at 23:54\nThe justification is in my answer. For more, you could try Lindvall's book \"Lectures on the Coupling Method\". This is the best possible bound: If you let $\\omega$ be uniformly distributed in the unit interval, then $g_X(\\omega)$ has the same distribution as $X$ and $g_Y(\\omega)$ has the same distribution as $Y$ and the product of these random variables has the integral in my answer. \u2013\u00a0 Anthony Quas Oct 10 '12 at 5:19\nDear Anthony, Still, it is not clear to me how to prove the inequality that you suggested : E[X*Y] <= \\int_{0}^{1} dt g_{X}(t) * g_{Y}(t). Is the proof in the book \"Lectures on the Coupling Method\"? It it not clear either wether and why this bound is better than the Holder's inequality bound E[X^p]^(1/p)*E[Y^q]^(1/q). Can you prove this? Thanks! Michele \u2013\u00a0 Michele Oct 16 '12 at 1:05\nIf you know that $X$ is uniformly distributed on the unit interval and $Y$ are is the uniformly distributed random variable on [1,2], then the bound I'm suggesting comes from $g_X(t)=t$, $g_Y(t)=1+t$, so that $\\mathbb E XY\\le \\int (t+t^2)\\,dt=5/6$. If you use H\\\"older's inequality, you get $(1/(p+1))^{1/p}((2^{q+1}-1)/(q+1))^{1/q}$. This is greater than 5/6 for all $1/p+1/q=1$. My bound is attained if $X$ is uniform and $Y=1+X$. In general, my bound is always attained for some joint distribution on $X$ and $Y$. The Holder bound is not always attained. So mine is lower and is best poss. \u2013\u00a0 Anthony Quas Oct 16 '12 at 5:57\nApparently the inequality I'm quoting goes by the name \"Hardy-Littlewood inequality\". See math.toronto.edu/almut/rearrange.pdf \u2013\u00a0 Anthony Quas Oct 16 '12 at 6:55\n\nI would try yo apply Hoeffding's Lemma, who used his result to identify the bivariate cdfs with given marginal cdfs that minimize or maximize correlation.

By Hoeffding's Lemma we get that $$E(XY)\\leq E(X)E(Y)+\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\big[\\min(F(x),G(y))-F(x)G(y)\\big]dxdy$$\n\nshare|improve this answer"}

(See the edit for an extension to noncommutative rings.)\n\nSuppose we have an isomorphism $\\phi: R[x] \\to S[[x]]$; let $a = \\phi^{-1}(x)$. First we claim that for all $b \\in R[x]$, the element $1 + ab$ is invertible in $R[x]$. Indeed, the element $\\phi(1 + ab) = 1 + (\\phi(b))x$ has an inverse given by a formal geometric series, so $\\phi^{-1}$ applied to this element must also be invertible.\n\nIn particular, $1 + ax$ must be invertible in $R[x]$. But it is well-known (in the commutative case) that any invertible polynomial $a_0 + a_1 x + \\ldots + a_n x^n$ has $a_0$ invertible and the other $a_i$ nilpotent. It follows quickly that $a$ must be nilpotent. But then $\\phi(a) = x$ is nilpotent in $S[[x]]$. We have reached an absurdity.\n\nEdit: Aided by Martin's excellent suggestion in his comment, we may easily extend the argument to noncommutative rings. Indeed, since $x$ is central in $S[[x]]$, we have that $a$ is central in $R[x]$. In particular, $a$ commutes with scalars; writing $a$ as a polynomial, it follows that each coefficient of $a$ is central in $R$. This is true also of the polynomial $1 + ax$, and now the proof that all but the unit coefficient of $1 + ax$ is nilpotent goes through as in the commutative case (see for example the nice argument given here). Thus $a$ is nilpotent.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIn order to reduce to the commutative case, one may try to compute the centers of $R[x]$ and $S[[x]]$. \u2013\u00a0 Martin Brandenburg Dec 29 '12 at 16:18\nThanks very much for that suggestion, Martin.

It might be worth opening another question if you're interested. \u2013\u00a0 Todd Trimble Dec 29 '12 at 18:07\nAnother suggestion: In the end of the argument, just use the commutative case with $Z(R)[x]$. \u2013\u00a0 Martin Brandenburg Dec 30 '12 at 12:11\n\nThanks to Martin Brandenburg suggestion, if $R[x] \\cong S[[x]]$ then their centers are isomorphic too. So without loose of generality we can assume that $R$ and $S$ are commutative. In commutative case we know $J(R[x]) = Nil(R[x])$. This means that elements in the Jacobson radical of $R[x]$ are all nilpotent. On the other hand $x \\in J(S[[x]])$ and $x$ is not nilpotent. This shows that $R[x]$ and $S[[x]]$ can not be isomorphic.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIn your argument you seem to be assuming that $R[x]$ is Jacobson.

If we added a mass term without introducing the Higgs field, but the coupling current is still conserved, at what point would the theory break down? It seems to me that the scalar modes decouple as well, at least to tree level. I failed to push the calculation to one loop order, so maybe the theory breaks down here. Is this the most immediate source of problems, or is there any simpler observable which fails to be gauge invariant?\n\nOne would often hear that if we break gauge invariance the theory is no longer renormalisable. I may be too na\u00efve but it seems to me that a (gauge-fixed) massive gauge boson has a $\\mathcal O(p^{-2})$ propagator and therefore (as long as the current in the vertices is conserved) the theory is (power counting) renormalisable. Or is it?\n\nTo keep things focused, let us imagine that we wanted to give gluons mass, while keeping self-interactions and the coupling to matter (and ghosts) unchanged. Could this work without a Higgs?\n\nThere are many posts about that are asking similar things. For example,\n\n  \u2022 4\n    $\\begingroup$ Nothing goes wrong, just the theory becomes strongly coupled at $4\\pi m_V/g$ where $m_V$ is the mass and $g$ the gauge coupling. It is simple to see this because the longitudinal polarization grows with energy. In fact, by a gauge redefinition one can make this apparent reintroducing the eaten Goldstone bosons. In practice, the Higgs mechanism is there in any case, it's the Higgs particle that could be missing. The theory has a cutoff which is at most $4\\pi v$, where $v=m_V/g$ is the vev, as for any theory of Goldstone bosons that are derivatively coupled. The simplest UV completion adds h. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0TwoBs Dec 6 '16 at 16:05\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ @TwoBs thanks for the comment. What you describe is not really true for an abelian gauge theory: the longitudinal polarisations would grow, but in fact they cancel (because of current conservation) and therefore the S matrix elements don't grow with energy (massive QED is UV finite, and perturbatively unitary). But this seems to fail for non-abelian gauge theories. Why is a non-abelia gauge theory different than an abelian one? is it because, unlike QED, the longitudinal polarisations don't cancel (even if the current is conserved)? $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0AccidentalFourierTransform Dec 6 '16 at 16:20\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ It's very simple to understand: for the abelian case the mass gives rise just a free kinetic term for the would be goldstone bosons, whereas for the non-abelian case it give rise to a non-trivial derivatively coupled interactions. The reason is because the coset structure of$U(1)\\rightarrow 0$ is a circle which is one-dimensional and hence there is no non trivial Riemann curvature, whereas for non-abelian cosets, e.g. $SU(2)\\rightarrow U(1)$, they have non trivial Riemann ( it's a sphere above). The longitudinal polarizations, that is the Goldstones, couple with coefficients given by Riemann. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0TwoBs Dec 6 '16 at 23:05\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ @TwoBs nice, thanks!

I have good news and bad news. The good news is that this exact same question is asked and answered in Quantum Field Theory, by Itzykson & Zuber, section 12-5-2. The bad news is that the answer is\n\nIf you introduce mass terms in non-abelian gauge theories by hand, the theory is non-renormalisable.\n\nThis means that one is forced to introduce the Higgs mechanism (or variations thereof, such as the St\u00fcckelberg mechanism), which for some people is rather inelegant (and plagued by problems of naturalness, etc). Oh well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.\n\nLet me quote the first paragraph of the aforementioned section, so as to summarise the main point of the problem:\n\nIs a gauge theory where mass terms are introduced by hand renormalizable?\n\nIn electrodynamics, the situation is favorable. After separation of the gauge field into transverse and longitudinal components, the longitudinal part $k_\\mu k_\\nu/M^2$ which gives rise to the bad behavior in the propagator does not contribute to the $S$ matrix. This results from the noninteraction of longitudinal and transverse components and from the coupling of the field to a conserved current. In a nonabelian theory, none of these properties is satisfied. Longitudinal and transverse parts do interact, while the current to which the gauge field is coupled is not conserved. On the other hand, unexpected cancellations of divergences at the one-loop level make the theory look like renormalizable. This explains why it took some time to reach a consensus, namely, that the theory is not renormalizable. The way out of this unpleasant situation is to appeal to the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, to be explained in the next subsection.\n\n\nYour Answer"}
{"problem": "What is the expected number of rolls required to obtain a specific outcome (e.g., rolling a six) when using a fair six-sided die?", "final_answer": "6", "raw_text": "Retrieved from https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/42930/what-is-the-expected-value-of-the-number-of-die-rolls-necessary-to-get-a-specifi\nText:\nGiven a discrete random number generator, such as a six-sided die, what is the expected value of the number of rolls necessary to roll a specific number (e.g. a six)?\n\nI think the result should be given by E$\\langle$rolls$\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{6}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{(\\frac{5}{6})^n(n+1)}$, but I don't know how to calculate the convergence of that sum.\n\nAlso, how do I calculate the variance?\n\n\nA slightly simpler recursive derivation is this. We must roll the die at least once. On the first roll we get a 6 with probability $\\frac{1}{6}$. Otherwise we start again. Hence, $E = 1 + \\frac{5}{6}E$, which gives $E=6$.\n\nHere is a more general answer:\n\nRegard rolling the die as a Bernoulli process $X_1,X_2, \\ldots$, where $X_i = $ Success, with probability $p$, and $X_i = $ Failure, with probability $1-p$. The process stops after the first success.\n\nLet $N_s$ be the length of the sequence until the first Success. This is a random integer. Then we have $$ \\Pr (N_s=k) = \\Pr(\\underbrace{FF\\cdots F}_{k-1}\\ S) = \\underbrace{(1-p)(1-p)\\cdots(1-p)}_{k-1}\\ p=(1-p)^{k-1}p=pq^{k-1}, $$ where $q=1-p$ and $k\\ge1$. This is called a Geometric Distribution, which is the discrete equivalent of the Exponential Distribution. Random variables with these distributions are called memoryless. (See Ross, Introduction to Probability Models, 9th Edition, page 284.)\n\nThe expected value and variance of $N_s \\sim \\text{Geom}(p)$ are $$ \\text{E}{N_s(p)}=\\frac{1}{p}, \\text{ and } \\text{Var}{N_s(p)} = \\frac{1-p}{p^2}. $$Proof can be found in Ross, above. Note that $$\\text{E}{N_s(p)} = 1 +(1-p)\\text{E}{N_s(p)}, \\text{ whose solution is } \\frac{1}{p}.$$\n\nIn your case $p = \\frac{1}{6}\\,$ and so E(No. rolls) = 6, and Var(No. rolls) = 30 -- Geom$(\\frac{1}{6})$ has a long tail.\n\n\nOne \"trick\" that often lets you avoid issues of convergence when solving probability problems is to use a recursive argument.\n\nYou have a 1/6 probability of rolling a 6 right away, and a 5/6 chance of rolling something else and starting the process over (but with one additional roll under your belt).\n\nLet $E$ be the expected number of rolls before getting a 6; by the reasoning above, we have:\n\n$E = (1)(1/6) + (E + 1)(5/6)$\n\nSolving for $E$ yields $E = 6$.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use the generating function. The generating function $G(t)$ for a probability distribution that only takes on integer values is defined as:\n\n$G(t) = \\Sigma_{i = 0}^{\\infty} p_i t^i$\n\nThe reason the generating function comes in handy is that $G'(1)$ gives the expected value and $G''(1) + G'(1) - (G'(1))^2$ gives the variance; one can check this directly.\n\nIn our case, the generating function is:\n\n$G(t) = (1/6)t + (1/6)(5/6)t^2 + (1/6)(5/6)^2t^3 + \\ldots$\n\nWe can rewrite this as follows:\n\n$G(t) = (1/5)(5t/6 + (5t/6)^2 + (5t/6)^3 + \\ldots)$\n\nSumming the geometric series gives $G(t) = t/(6-5t)$; from here, we can calculate $G'(t)$ and $G''(t)$, plug in $t = 1$, and use the above expressions to extract both the expected value and the variance (6 and 30, respectively).\n\n\nElliott's answer is surely the nicest. To sum the series, we can use a method similar to the geometric series.\n\nLet $$S = 1 + 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) + 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 + \\cdots $$\n\n\n$$\\frac{5}{6}S = \\frac{5}{6} + 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 + 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 + \\cdots $$\n\n$$S - \\frac{5}{6}S = 1+ \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) +\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 + \\cdots $$\n\nThis is just a geometric series and hence we have that\n\n$$S = 36$$\n\nNow we have that $$\\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^n (n+1) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot S = 6,$$ as expected.\n\n(Convergence of the series can be seen by the ratio test)\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Very nice. It's great to see so many different ways to find the convergence value for power series. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0jeremy radcliff Jan 25 '17 at 21:12\n\nHere's an intuitive argument. Roll the die $6000$ times. You'd expect there to be $1000$ 6's among them. Consider the gaps between successive 6's in the list (plus the initial gap to the first 6). These lengths are the values of independent draws from a geometric RV with $p=1/6$, so the average gap length is the expected value you want.\n\nThe sum of these (~1000) gap lengths is 6000, and so the average gap is $6000/1000=6$ (modulo a little fudge at the end which would go to $0$ by making the string longer).\n\n\nI'm late to the party, but here's a slightly different path to the same solution. Let $X$ be the number of die rolls until we roll a specific number. Let $p$ be the probability that we roll the specific number and $q = 1-p$ be the probability that we roll any of the other numbers. We know\n\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X] \\triangleq 1p + 2qp + 3q^2 p + 4q^3p + \\dots $$\n\nNote that the geometric series $\\sum_{x=1}^{\\infty} q^x = \\frac{q}{1-q}$. Using this fact and a little algebra and calculus, we get,\n\n$$ \\begin{align} \\mathbb{E}[X] &= 1p + 2qp + 3q^2 p + 4q^3p + \\dots \\\\ &= \\sum_{x = 0}^{\\infty} (x + 1) q^x p \\\\ &= \\sum_{x = 1}^{\\infty} x q^{x-1} p \\\\ &= \\sum_{x = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} q^x p \\\\ &= p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} \\Big( \\sum_{x = 1}^{\\infty} q^x \\Big) \\\\ &= p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} \\Big( \\frac{q}{1-q} \\Big) \\\\ &= p \\frac{1}{(1 - q)^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\frac{1}{6}}{\\big(1 - \\frac{5}{6}\\big)^2} \\\\ &= 6 \\end{align} $$\n\n\nYour Answer"}

Feb 23 '19 at 19:44\n\nIf there are only two players, you could use integer linear programming.\n\nI'll introduce some zero-or-one integer variables to encode the (unknown) bidding functions (via a one-hot encoding). Let $x_{v,b}=1$ if player $0$'s bid is $b$ when their valuation is $v$, and $0$ otherwise; and $y_{w,c}=1$ if player $1$'s bid is $c$ when their valuation is $w$, and $0$ otherwise. In this way, if there are $n$ possible valuations, we obtain $2n^2$ zero-or-one integer variables. We will write down linear inequalities on these variables that characterize the optimality condition, then use an integer programming solver to find a solution that satisfies all of these inequalities.\n\nNote that if player $0$'s valuation is $v$ and player $1$'s valuation is $w$, then player $0$'s payoff (in a first-price auction) is\n\n$$\\sum_{b>c} x_{v,b} y_{w,c} (v-b).$$\n\nTherefore, if player $0$'s valuation is $v$, player $0$'s expected payoff is\n\n$$\\sum_w p_1(w) \\sum_{b>c} x_{v,b} y_{w,c} (v-b),$$\n\nwhere $p_1(w)$ represents the probability that player $1$ gets valuation $w$. Now, we need this to be at least what it would be if player $0$ used any other bid for valuation $v$, i.e., any other choice of $x_{v,\\cdot}$'s. If there are $n$ possible valuations, there are only $n$ possible bids, so we obtain $n$ inequalities\n\n$$\\sum_w p_1(w) \\sum_{b>c} x_{v,b} y_{w,c} (v-b) \\ge \\sum_w p_1(w) \\sum_{b'>c} y_{w,c} (v-b'),$$\n\nwhere we obtain one such inequality for each possible value of $b'$. (The sum on the left-hand-side is over $w,b,c$ that satisfy the condition $b>c$; the sum on the right-hand-side is over $w,c$ that satisfy the condition $c<b'$.)\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality. We'll turn it into a linear inequality using the techniques of Express boolean logic operations in zero-one integer linear programming (ILP). In particular, introduce new zero-or-one variables $t_{v,w,b,c}$, with the intention that $t_{v,w,b,c}=x_{v,b} y_{w,c}$. This can be enforced using the linear inequalities $t_{v,w,b,c} \\ge x_{v,b} + y_{w,c} - 1$, $t_{v,w,b,c} \\le x_{v,b}$, $t_{v,w,b,c} \\le y_{w,c}$, $0 \\le t_{v,w,b,c} \\le 1$. Now the optimality condition becomes\n\n$$\\sum_w p_1(w) \\sum_{b>c} t_{v,w,b,c} (v-b) \\ge \\sum_w p_1(w) \\sum{b'>c} y_{w,c} (v-b'),$$\n\nfor each $v,b'$. We obtain one such inequality for each $v$ and each $b'$. These $n^2$ inequalities ensure that player $0$'s strategy will be optimal (given player $1$'s strategy).\n\nThen, add similar inequalities to require player $1$'s strategy to be optimal (given player $0$'s strategy).\n\nAlso add the $n^2+n$ constraints that $0 \\le x_{v,b} \\le 1$ and $\\sum_b x_{v,b}=1$ to require the $x$'s to correspond to a bidding function, and similarly for the $y$'s.\n\nFinally, take all of these inequalities and feed them to an off-the-shelf integer linear programming solver. If it finds a solution, then you have found a Nash equilibrium for your game. ILP is NP-hard, so there is no guarantee that it will terminate in a reasonable amount of time, but in my experience often the solvers can handle surprisingly large systems of inequalities.\n\nThe same approach can handle all-pay auctions as well as first-price auctions.\n\nIn practice, you might be able to speed up the solver by adding some extra constraints to help it identify a solution faster. In particular, I have a hunch that without loss of generality the optimal bidding function can be assumed to be monotonic: if we increase my valuation, my bid should never decrease. We can add extra inequalities to the system to characterize this additional assumption, and this might narrow the search space and thus help the ILP solver find a solution more rapidly.\n\nOne big limitation is that this seems limited to two players (or a very small number of players). If there are multiple players, the number of variables and inequalities will explode, and this might not be an effective approach.\n\n\nYour Answer"}

Energy = power x time. So your 12V battery of 150Ah needs 1800Wh of energy (12 x 150). So a 25W PV panel would need 72 hours at full output (1800Wh/25W).\n\nThe equation is: Peak-hours required = $\\frac{V_{batt} \\times capacity_{batt}}{Power_{PV}} $\n\nThat's an unusual combination of quite a small panel and a very big battery - is the battery designed to be a multi-week store for a low-power system, by any chance?\n\nFor a more accurate answer, you need a lot more information.\n\nThe output of the panel at any moment will depend on:\n\n(1) the voltage, (which will be determined by the battery, and will change as the battery charges)\n\n(2) the ambient temperature, and\n\n(3) the amount light hitting the panel. The amount of light hitting the panel will depend on panel tilt, orientation, overshading, weather, altitude, location, time of year, time of day.\n\nFor (1), you need the panel IV curve, typically presented on the manufacturer's datasheet. That datasheet will also tell you how output varies with panel temperature. You can then estimate the panel's temperature from the ambient temperature - it will (to the first order) be a fairly steady amount above ambient.\n\nHere are some example power curves for a 12V PV (and it looks like it's approx 125W peak) panel, from altestore.com :\n\nPV panel I-V curve\n\nYou also need to know about the battery's characteristics as it charges: the heat losses, and how its voltage changes with temperature and % charged. In a more complex system that involves a controller too, you'd need to know how the controller behaves, how it tracks the maximum power point, and what its internal losses are. A controller is very desirable, not only because it will track the PV panel's maximum power point, but also because it will prevent the battery over-charging.\n\nThere are various online PV calculators that will combine some of this information to give you estimates of output, such as the US NREL PVWATTS calculator. And there are free online GIS insolation resources to give you the raw source information to do detailed calculations yourself, such as the EU PVGIS database.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI think it's the combination of biggest standard pickup/SUV battery and largest (cheap) battery top-up solar panel \u2013\u00a0 Martin Beckett Aug 3 '11 at 4:23\nadd comment\n\n150 Amper*hour is the battery charge capacity. With power of 25 Watt = 25 A*V at V = 12 V you will supply 25/12 Coulomb each second (Amper*s). So the charge time is equal to 150/(25/12) = 72 hours.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nIn the simplest case, and some unmentioned assumptions, the minimum charging time would be given by the formula already mentioned: $$ T = \\frac{V \\times Ah}{W}$$ this gives 12x150/25 = 72 hours.\n\nHowever, this case makes at least two major assumptions, the battery is fully discharged and there are no losses of any kind!\n\nIn the real world, the battery will not be fully discharged and there are energy losses \"everywhere.\" Just to drive the point home, if the battery is already charged, then the time would be zero.\n\nA typical 12V battery is considered \"discharged\" when its voltage is reduced to 9V. This means it has lost only 1/4 of its energy. Everything else remaining the same, it would only need 1/4 of the time (18 hrs) to charge up. If we assume 50% efficiency, this would bring the time up to 36 hours. Assuming 8 hrs per day of sunshine, it would take about 4 days.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYou need to know the implication of using a 25W panel, for me that is pretty small. The idea is 150Ah at 12 V (DC) we need to apply the 10hr charging method, so 10% of 150Ah gives 15A.$$\\frac{150\\,\\text{Ah}}{10\\,\\text h}=15\\,\\text A$$\n\nSo power of needed solar panel is computed as follows, $12\\,\\text V\\cdot15\\,\\text A=180\\,\\text W$.

Thank you! \u2013\u00a0 NPE Dec 14 '12 at 7:09\n\nThe general pythagorean triple can be written (up to swapping $a$ and $b$) as $$a=2kuv$$ $$b=k(u^2-v^2)$$ $$ c=k(u^2+v^2)$$ where $k,u,v$ are positive integers, $u,v$ are relatively prime with different parity and $u\\geq v$. For $a+b+c=40$, then, you get the condition $2k(u^2+uv)=40$, so you need $u^2+uv=u(u+v)$ to be a factor of $20$. Since $u,v$ have different parity, and they are positive, you know $u+v>1$ is odd, so $u+v=5$.\n\nGiven that $u\\geq v$, that yields $u=4,v=1$ and $u=3,v=2$. But $u=3$ isn't possible, since $3$ is not a factor of $20$. So The only solution is $(u,v)=(4,1)$ and therefore the only solution is $k(15,8,17)$ which you can see must have $k=1$, and you are done - the only solution is $(15,8,17)$. And $(8,15,17)$, if you count that as different.\n\nFor the more general problem, $a+b+c=2n$ (the sum of a Pythagorean triple is always even) this amounts to factoring $n=kuw$ with the following conditions:\n\n  \u2022 $k,u,w$ are positive in\n  \u2022 $w$ is odd\n  \u2022 $u<w<2u$\n\nGiven such a solution, you get a triple (by setting $v=w-u$:) $$a=2ku(w-u)$$ $$b=kw(2u-w)$$ $$c=k(2u^2+w^2-2uw)$$\n\nAnd this gives all such triples (modulo swapping $a$ and $b$.)\n\nListing these amounts to first listing the set of possible values of $w$, which can be any odd factors of $n$ such that $1<w<\\sqrt{2n}$. Then find values of $u$ with $w/2<u<w$ and $uw|n$. Then set $k=n/uw$ and you have your triple $(k,u,w)$ from which you can compute an $(a,b,c)$.\n\n(If you want to allow $ab=0$, the change the above to $u\\leq w < 2u$.

Before Brian pointed out that it was a duplicate, I came up with a solution different from the shortlist solution. (I treat the problem of emptying one of the piles, which, as discussed in Phira's answer and comments, is equivalent.)\n\nThe idea is to successively produce $0$s in the binary representations of two of the numbers, starting with the least significant bit. So assume that the last $k$ bits of $b$ and $c$ are already zero; then if neither $b$ nor $c$ is zero yet, our aim is to make the last $k+1$ bits of two of the numbers zero.\n\nSo consider the $(k+1)$-th bits of $b$ and $c$. If they're both $0$, we're done. If they're both $1$, we just need one transfer between $b$ and $c$ to make them both $0$. If one is $0$ and one is $1$, we can put the $1$ in the lesser of the two by transferring from the greater to the lesser until it becomes the lesser.\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume $b\\lt c$. Now there are two cases. If $a\\ge b$, we can get rid of the $1$ by a transfer from $a$ to $b$. Otherwise, $a\\lt b\\lt c$, and we transfer first from $b$ to $a$ and then from $c$ to $b$, thus going from $a,b,c$ to $2a,b-a,c$ to $2a,2(b-a),c+a-b$. Now the sum of the first two numbers is $2b$, which has $0$s in the last $k+1$ bits, so we can make the last $k+1$ bits of those two numbers $0$ by making transfers between them, each of which gets rid of their last $1$ bits.\n\nIf we initially assign $a$, $b$ and $c$ such that $a$ has the fewest final zeros, this strategy seems to be slightly more efficient than the shortlist strategy: Compared to the total of $103505$ transfers minimally required to solve all distinct instances with totals less than $100$, this strategy makes $172865$ transfers while the shortlist strategy makes $190994$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThe $2b$ trick is nice.

How do you get r alone?  Thanks for your help!\n\nDate: 06/16/2006 at 10:17:55\nFrom: Doctor Peterson\nSubject: Re: What is this formula used for?\n\nHi, Debbie.\n\nFirst, you don't need to even ask what a formula is for in this sort \nof problem.  One of the most important things about algebra (or math \nin general, really) is that it is abstract: that is, we can take all \nsorts of real-world problems and turn them into math problems (such \nas equations to solve), and once you've done that, it doesn't matter \nat all where they came from.  The methods you use in algebra ignore \nthe meaning of the problem, and just look at the equation itself.\n\nMany equations you'll work with in class don't come from anywhere at \nall; you are just practicing techniques that you can use on problems \nthat do have some real-world meaning.  It's sort of like a medical \nstudent practicing an operation on a dummy; he doesn't have to ask \nabout the patient's family or insurance!  But when he gets into real \nmedicine, all those things will matter.  In this case, the equation \nMIGHT relate to interest on a bank account, with r being the interest \nrate; but the same equation could come from other sorts of problems, \ntoo--or none at all.\n\nNow, to solve this equation for r, the important thing is to make \nsure that at each step you are making a new equation that is still \ntrue--that is, an equivalent equation.  We know that if we do the \nsame thing to each side, e.g. adding the same thing, the new equation \nwill be equivalent.  But often students don't pay close attention to \nwhat they are doing, and they don't really make an equivalent \n\nLook closely at what you did:\n\n      M = C(1 + r)\n     -C  -C\n  M - C =  (1 + r)\n\nWhat you say you are doing is subtracting C from both sides.  But \nthat's not really what you did.  When you do the subtraction (without \nsimplifying anything), you actually get\n\n  M - C = C(1 + r) - C\n\nNow you have to simplify, and you can't just cross off the C's!  If we \nexpand C(1 + r) using the distributive property, we get\n\n  M - C = C + Cr - C\n\nand then combining like terms gives\n\n  M - C = Cr\n\nThat's not what you got!  Why?  Because you didn't actually subtract C \nfrom the right side, but just crossed something off, thinking it was \nthe right thing to do.  This is a very common mistake!  You must \nalways think of the subtraction as making a change to the equation and \nthen simplifying, not just as canceling something.\n\nWe can continue, now--even though what you did is not the recommended\nmethod, which I will get to in a minute.  Look at the equation we have \n\n  M - C = Cr\n\nWhat is our goal?  To get r by itself.  We're almost there; all that's \n\"wrong\" with this is that r is multiplied by C, and we can get rid of\nthat by dividing by C.  So let's divide BOTH SIDES by C, again making \nsure that's really what we do:\n\n  M - C   Cr\n  ----- = --\n    C     C\n\nNow we can simplify the right side; multiplying r by C and then \ndividing by C undoes the multiplication and just leaves r:\n\n  M - C\n  ----- = r\n\nAnd that's our answer!\n\nNow, there are two other methods that make the first step easier than \nwhat we ended up doing.  One is to always simplify both sides of an \nequation before we start solving:\n\n  M = C(1 + r)\n\n  M = C + Cr\n\n(I distributed on the right side.)\n\nNow we want to get r alone; on the right side it is FIRST being \nmultiplied by C (remember the order of operations?) and THEN we're \nadding C to it.  To get it by itself, we have to undo both operations; \nand we do that in reverse order.  (For example, in the morning I put \non my socks first, then my shoes; to undo that at night, I take off \nmy shoes first, then my socks.)  So we'll first undo the addition of \nC, by subtracting C from both sides:\n\n    M   =   C + Cr\n  - C     - C\n  M - C =       Cr\n\nWhat this really means is that we are subtracting C from both sides \nlike this:\n\n  M - C = C + Cr - C = Cr\n\nwhere I simplified the right side by combining the like terms C and \n\nNow we're right where we were in the first method, and just have to \ndivide by C to finish.\n\nThere's another way we could have done this, without simplifying \nfirst; we'd look at the equation as given and see that in\n\n  M = C(1 + r)\n\nwe are FIRST adding 1 to r, and THEN multiplying by C.  We can undo \nthat by FIRST dividing both sides by C, and THEN subtracting 1 from \nboth sides.  The answer we get would look different, but would mean \nthe same thing.  If you wish, you may try doing that; but the method \nI've shown is what is usually taught.  I mention it because it is \nclose to what you tried to do: you wanted to get rid of the C first; \nbut because it is being MULTIPLIED rather than added, you have to \nDIVIDE by it rather than subtract, in order to eliminate it.  What you \nreally did was to subtract C from the left side and divide by C on \nthe right, which didn't give an equivalent equation.\n\n\n- Doctor Peterson, The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nMiddle School Equations\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM\n\u00a9 1994-2013 The Math Forum"}

To find the points of intersection between those two graphs, set them equal to each other.\n\n    [tex] 2-x^2 = x [/tex]\n\n    [tex] x^2 + x = 2 [/tex]\n\n    An obvious one is x=1.\n\n    Try quadratic formula.\n    Last edited: Jun 13, 2005\n  4. Jun 13, 2005 #3\n    sorry whozum i dont think i explained the question well, i need to work out the points of intersection i have no problems working out the area.\n\n    yeh ive already got 1. so using the quadratic formula i should be able to find the points out?\n  5. Jun 13, 2005 #4\n    so the intersecting points are -2 & 1?\n  6. Jun 13, 2005 #5\n    There you go. Graph it to make sure.\n  7. Jun 13, 2005 #6\n    hello there\n\n    well first of all you need to find where both functions actually intersect this is done by making 2-x^2=x then using the quadratic formulae to find where they intersect, and so you will find that they will intersect at 1 and at -2 now if you want to find the area between these functions its best that you graph it and then split up the area which should correspond to the addition to a couple of integrals\n    [tex]\\int_0^1 2-x-x^2 dx+\\int_{-\\sqrt{2}}^0 2-x^2+x dx-\\int_{-2}^{-\\sqrt 2} x -2+x^2 dx[/tex]\n    by integrating you will be able to find the area between those two functions?\n    by the way y=2-x^2 has roots at +/-sqrt{2}\n    the area is 2.5 units hopefully with out any small errors\n    Last edited: Jun 13, 2005\n  8.

For all x between -2 and 1, 2- x2 is larger than x so 2-x2- x is positive and is the \"height\" of a thin rectangle between the two. The area is\n    [tex]\\int_{-2}^1 2- x- x^2 dx= \\frac{9}{2}= 4.5[/tex].\n  10.

This probability might be much higher for someone who tends to golf, mountain climb, fish, etc during lightning storms.\n\nIt also presumes that the individual could survive the first strike, which unfortunately might not be very likely.\n\nThanks for using NEWTON!\n\nRic Rupnik\n\n\nLightning does not know whether you have been struck previously. After you are struck, you have a 1 in 600,000 chance of being struck a second time. The probability of being struck twice can be worked out as follows. Consider 600,000 sets of events. In the first 599,999 you are never struck. In the last you are struck at least once. This is the 1 in 600,000 chance of being struck at least once. Make each of these sets 600,000 events. All of the first 599,999 sets of 600,000 events are \"never struck\"(359,999,400,000 events). In the last set of 600,000 events, the first 599,999 are \"only struck once\". The last is \"struck more then once\". This is a total of 360,000,000,000 events. The probabilities are:\n\nnever struck: (599,999 in 600,000),or (359,999,400,000 in 360,000,000,000)\n\nstruck exactly once: (599,999 in 360,000,000,000),or essentially (1 in 600,000)\n\nstruck more than once: 1 in 360,000,000,000 (1 in 360 billion)\n\nDr. Ken Mellendorf\nPhysics Instructor\nIllinois Central College\n\nClick here to return to the Mathematics Archives\n\n\n\nEducational Programs\nBuilding 360\n9700 S.

I followed the example in the DESeq2 manual for creating a term (ind.n) distiguishing individuals nested within groups, but now I'm not sure how to create the full and reduced model given that I have one more level than the example.\n\nI've tried a really elaborate full model (m1) with the interaction term of interest (Injection:Social) removed for the reduced model (m2), but I'm not sure this is correct based on our design.\n\nm1 <- model.matrix(~ Injection + Injection:ind.n + Injection:Social + Injection:Region + Social + Social:ind.n + Social:Region + Region, colData_filt)\nm2 <- model.matrix(~ Injection + Injection:ind.n + Injection:Region + Social + Social:ind.n + Social:Region + Region, colData_filt)\n\nI'm assuming this is wrong, but even if this was by some miracle the correct formulation, would there be a way to extract genes that explain the \"Injection:Social\" interaction term for separate brain regions?\n\nAs a work-around, I subsetted the data by region and ran three separate LRT analyses for each subset and compared the results. While this simplified the model to look like the first example above, I worry that we lose some power by ignoring the fact we have multiple brain region samples from single individuals across the dataset.\n\nAny guidance is much appreciated. Thanks in advance\n\n\nFrom what I can gather, you want to account for the effect of individual, nested within region. That is, you want to see after accounting for these, is there a consistent effect for Injection:Social across all conditions.\n\nSo you set up the model like this:\n\nm1 <- model.matrix(~ ind.n*Region + Injection + Social + Injection:Social,data=..)\n\nThe last term should be Injection:Region and you can just use the waldTest (default) in DESeq2 for this term.\n\nWhat does the terms do? ind.n*Region is the equivalent of ind.n + Region + ind.n:Region , and with this you effectively get an effect for every region in every individual.\n\nWhy don't we need the Injection:ind.n or Social:ind.n or Social:Region. These terms indicate the effect of Injection or Social can vary by individuals or regions. Most likely introducing too many parameters when you are interested in a common effect. Also you do not have the replicates or samples to distinguish this effect from region or other effects.\n\nSince you provided an example we can run DESeq2 and you can see how the results look like:\n\nmat = counts(makeExampleDESeqDataSet(n=1000,m=48))\ndds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(mat,df,~ ind.n*Region + Injection + Social + Injection:Social)\n\ndds = DESeq(dds)\n\n [1] \"Intercept\"            \"ind.n_S2_vs_S1\"       \"Region_NS_vs_HY\"     \n [4] \"Region_TN_vs_HY\"      \"Injection_S_vs_L\"     \"Social_KF_vs_ISO\"    \n [7] \"Social_KFC_vs_ISO\"    \"Social_NF_vs_ISO\"     \"ind.nS2.RegionNS\"    \n[10] \"ind.nS2.RegionTN\"     \"InjectionS.SocialKF\"  \"InjectionS.SocialKFC\"\n[13] \"InjectionS.SocialNF\" \n\nThe terms you need are \"InjectionS.SocialKF\",\"InjectionS.SocialKFC\", \"InjectionS.SocialNF\", and you can look at each of them:\n\nlog2 fold change (MLE): InjectionS.SocialNF \nWald test p-value: InjectionS.SocialNF \nDataFrame with 6 rows and 6 columns\n              baseMean     log2FoldChange             lfcSE               stat\n             <numeric>          <numeric>         <numeric>          <numeric>\ngene1  9.9811166787259   1.25304112986447 0.819806376919295   1.52845984752303\ngene2 30.3449455820337 0.0329442893152027 0.705199688255367 0.0467162562092241\ngene3 3.83223545055379    1.0281136369045  1.64095596190233  0.626533350543196\ngene4  11.232305747171  0.595738624408923   0.8243883031544  0.722643227868976\ngene5 6.70950627004097  0.756449993378065   1.0631622863378  0.711509430967263\ngene6 26.1431134888287 -0.854784518963918 0.625714541243558  -1.36609342219393\n                 pvalue              padj\n              <numeric>         <numeric>\ngene1 0.126398405431826 0.978671002658464\ngene2 0.962739373909937 0.999897888026606\ngene3 0.530965168963838 0.978671002658464\ngene4 0.469899103018657 0.978671002658464\ngene5 0.476768608734069 0.978671002658464\ngene6 0.171909642630577 0.978671002658464\n\nAs mentioned, you can do a LRT if you want to test all the Injection:Social term interactions terms at one go, that is, the null hypothesis is that all of them are zero:\n\ndds = nbinomLRT(dds,reduced=~ ind.n*Region + Injection + Social)\n\nUsually the individual terms are more intuitively than testing all of them are zero, but you might have a special need for this.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Thank you, I will try this soon. Just to clarify, an LRT would still be appropriate for the larger question of finding the effect of the \"Injection:Social\" term and you suggest Wald for determining the region-specific impacts? Would it also be valid include a term like \"Injection:Social:Region\" in the suggested Wald model formulation in an attempt to explore the interactive effects of \"Injection:Social\" by region, or would that require more 3-way interaction terms with \"ind.n\"? $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0jfaberha Jun 23 at 17:30\n  \u2022 1\n    $\\begingroup$ @jfaberha, thanks for providing the data, i have updated my answer, hopefully its clearer now.

One question posed by the PI of this study is - what are the genes responsive to the \"Injection:Social\" interaction term in each of the different brain regions and are they different? I was guessing that maybe a 3-way interaction term could address this in the binomial Wald analysis, but I agree that adds excessive complexity to the model. That's said, I'm not sure how to get region-specific interactions without running separate analyses. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0jfaberha Jun 23 at 19:49\n  \u2022 1\n    $\\begingroup$ The main question is regarding the Injection:Social term across the dataset, with the brain region-specific interactions being less important follow-up. That said, I will move forward with LRT for the primary question and separate analyses for the region-specific analyses.

What is the probability that\ntwo units will be in the maintenance shop at the same time for \n\nAssuming the MTBF is quoted in operational hours, the failure\ndistribution is exponential, and the \"2 months per year\" operational\ntime is spread evenly through the year (e.g., 4 hours per day), it\nfollows that the mean calender time between failures of a specific\nunit is 12,000 hours.  Also, a unit spends 168 hours (=1 week) in \nthe shop each time it fails.  Therefore, each unit has a mean duty\ncycle of 12168 hours, of which 12000 are spent in the field and 168\nare spent in the shop.\n\nThe periods in the shop are random and uncorrelated for each of the \n10 units.  The probability of any particular unit being in the shop \nat a randomly chosen instant is just p = 168/12168.  The probability\nof two specific units being in the shop at a random instant is p^2.\nIn general, the probability of exactly k out of 10 units being in the\nshop at a given instant is \n              Pr{k}  =   ----------  p^k (1-p)^(10-k)\n                         (10-k)! k!\n\nso the probability of finding exactly 2 units in the shop is 0.007675,\nwhereas the probability of TWO OR MORE in the shop is 0.007970.\n\nOf course, the above analysis makes several tacit assumptions, and in\nreality the probability could be significantly higher or lower, for \nany of several reasons.  For example, we didn't specify that all the\noperational periods were independent and uniformly distributed over\nthe year, so it's possible that all the units are operational for the \nsame 2-month period each year, which would increase the probability of\nhaving two in the shop at some point during the \"busy season\".  On the \nother hand, the real probability could also be much smaller.  Strictly \nspeaking, within the stated conditions of the original problem, the \nprobability of two or more units in the shop simultaneously could be \nanything from 0 to about 0.3874.  For example, if each unit operates \nfor EXACTLY 2000 hours between failures, we could stagger their repair \ncycles so that one fails every 200 hours, which is greater than the \none week repair time of 168 hours.  Thus, the probability of two in \nthe shop would be 0.  (One could also manipulate the probability by \nassuming the units operate in more or less mutually exclusive 2-month \nperiods during the year.)\n\nOn the other hand, if the units are operated in synchronized pairs\n(hopefully not two engines of a twin-engine airplane), and each fails\nevery 2000 hours exactly, then each pair is in the shop for 168 hours\nout of every 2168 hours, giving a probability of 0.0774.  If the five\npairs of units are staggerred, then the fraction of [active] time with\ntwo units in the shop would be 0.3874.\n\nIt might be interesting to figue out the maximum probability that\nwould be strictly consistent with the stated conditions of the\nproblem.  In many casually-stated probability problems it turns out\nthe answer can be anything on the interval from 0 to 1 (inclusive).\n\nReturn to MathPages Main Menu"}

Sorry, this approach only generates $2^n -n $ diagonals.\n\nLet $I$ be the $n \\times n$ identity matrix and let $D$ be a diagonal whose non-zero entries are indexed by $S$.\n\nFurther suppose that $D$ does not have exactly one zero entry.\n\nLet $\\pi$ be a perumation of the rows of $I$ whose fixed points are exactly $S$.

Here is a proof that $2^n-n$ is in fact the best one can do.\n\nAn $n \\times n$ bipartite graph is a bipartite graph with bipartition $([n]_r, [n]_c)$, where $[n]_r$ and $[n]_c$ are both copies of $[n]$. Let $G$ be an $n \\times n$ bipartite graph. Define $G'$ to be equivalent to $G$, if $G'$ can be obtained from $G$ by complementing the neighbourhoods of some vertices in $[n_r]$. Note that the equivalence class of $G$, denoted $[G]$, has size $2^n$.\n\nIt is easy to check that the following lemma proves the tightness of the bound.\n\nLemma. For any $n \\times n$ bipartite graph $G$, at most $2^n-n$ members of $[G]$ have a perfect matching.\n\nProof. For each $i \\in [n]_c$ there is a graph $G^i \\in [G]$ such that $i \\in [n_c]$ has degree 0 in $G^i$. Just pick the vertices in $[n]_r$ that are adjacent to $i$ in $G$ and complement their neighbourhoods. If all $G^i$ are distinct, then the lemma clearly follows. Otherwise, $G^i=G^j$ for some $i \\neq j$. Thus, both $i$ and $j$ have degree 0 in $G^i$. But now, the $n$ graphs obtained from $G^i$ by performing a single complementation each do not have a perfect matching.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThis seems to have a slight problem with the case of the configurations with exactly one zero. \u2013\u00a0 damiano Aug 9 '10 at 12:20\nNot with $n=3$ you can't :-) \u2013\u00a0 Robin Chapman Aug 9 '10 at 12:23\nI suppose that I cannot generate diagonals that have exactly $n-1$ ones in this way, since if I fix $n-1$ rows, then I automatically fix the last one.

So, there are at least $n$ forbidden diagonals.

Hope to hear from you soon.\n\nDate: 09/27/98 at 01:22:14\nFrom: Doctor Ken\nSubject: Re: Grass seed problem\n\n\nFirst I'll give you a sort of intuition-based solution, and then I'll \ngo back and be a little more formal, writing things out in algebraic \n\nThe first thing I noticed about this problem was that a pound of one \nkind of seed costs 45 cents, a pound of the other costs 65 cents, and \nwe want to make a mix that costs 55 cents. Well, 55 is halfway between \n45 and 65, so it seems like we should combine equal parts of the two \nkinds of seed. Since we need to use 200 pounds of the first kind, we \nshould use 200 pounds of the other kind, for a total of 400 pounds.  \n\nTo verify this solution, let's see how much the pieces would cost.  \n200 pounds of the first kind of seed would cost 200 * $0.45 = $90, and \n200 pounds of the second kind of seed would cost 200 * $0.65 = $130.  \nWe bought 400 pounds total and paid $220, so we paid on average \n$220/400 = $0.55. Seems to check out.\n\nNow, how can we use algebra to find this same solution? The first \nthing I usually try to do is to find a sentence (an English sentence, \nor whatever language you like best) that says something true and \nuseful about the problem. Then I translate that sentence into an \nalgebraic equation.  \n\nIn this problem, I think I'd make this sentence: \"The cost per pound \nof the combined seed mixture is 55 cents.\" Let's work on translating \nthat into an equation. First it becomes:\n\n   cost per pound = $0.55\n\nWhat is the cost per pound? It's the number you get when you divide \nthe total price by the number of pounds of seed:\n\n     total price\n    pounds of seed\n\nThe total price is the cost of the 45c part and the 65c part. The \nnumber of pounds of seed is the number of pounds of the first kind \nplus the number of pounds of the second kind. The only unknown thing \nhere is the number of pounds of the second kind, so let's call that x.\n\n    200*$0.45 + x*$0.65\n         200 + x\n\nNow we've done the translation. I'll leave it to you to work out the \nsolution from here, and verify that the answer really is 200.\n\n- Doctor Ken, The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nElementary Word Problems\nMiddle School Algebra\nMiddle School Word Problems\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM\n\u00a9 1994-2013 The Math Forum"}

It may help to read what we have to say \nabout the order of operations\n\n\nbut there is no specific technique we can give you. I'll just try to \nget you started, thinking through the problem until I see where to go.\n\nUsing our e-mail notation, your equation is\n\n\nLooking at this, I notice that 35 = 5*7, and that there is a 7 and a \n5 in the left side. So my first action is to add parentheses so that \nmultiplication by 5 will be the last operation performed; if we can \nmake the rest of the expression equal 7, we'll be in good shape. This \nis just a guess; it may turn out that we won't want to multiply by 5 \nat all.

But I do see, at least, that 7^2 is much\ntoo big, so we have to make it smaller, either by subtracting\nsomething big or by dividing. \n\nAs written, the division only affects 3^2; 3^2/3^2 is 1.

If we used all of both, we'd have\n\n  (2 + 7^2 - 3^2) / (3^2 - 1) = 42/10\n\nwhich is in the right ballpark but not a whole number, much less \nexactly 7. It doesn't help if we divide 42 by 3^2 or by 3 rather than \n3^2 - 1.\n\nNow we can try either adding more parentheses inside (2 + 7^2 - 3^2) \nto change what we are dividing, or pull the 2 outside of the \n\nAt this point I've finally looked ahead enough to see the solution. \nI'll leave you with just a hint: you'll want to take the first choice \nI mentioned in the last paragraph, and you'll have to change what you \ndivide by as well.

But it is good to get one's hands dirty and compute.\n\nIf $20!$ seems dauntingly large, calculate $10!$. You will note it ends with two zeros. Multiplying $10!$ by all the numbers from $11$ to $20$ except $15$ and $20$ will not add to the zeros. Multiplying by $15$ and $20$ will add one zero each.\n\nRemark: Suppose that we want to find the number of terminal zeros in something seriously large, like $2048!$. It is not hard to see that this number is $N$, where $5^N$ is the largest power of $5$ that divides $2048!$. This is because we need a $5$ and a $2$ for every terminal $0$, and the $5$s are the scarcer resource.\n\nTo find $N$, it is helpful to think in terms of money. Every number $n$ between $1$ and $2048$ has to pay a $1$ dollar tax for every $5$ \"in it.\" So $45$ has to pay $1$ dollar, but $75$ has to pay $2$ dollars, because $75=5^2\\cdot 3$. And a $5$-rich person like $1250$ has to pay $4$ dollars.\n\nLet us gather the tax in stages. First, everybody divisible by $5$ pays a dollar. These are $5$, $10$, $15$ and so on up to $2045$, that is, $5\\cdot 1, 5\\cdot 2,\\dots, 5\\cdot 409$. So there are $409$ of them. It is useful to bring in the \"floor\" or \"greatest integer $\\le x$ \" function, and call the number of dollars gathered in the first stage $\\lfloor 2048/5\\rfloor$.\n\nBut many numbers still owe some tax, namely $25,50,75,\\dots,2025$. Get them to pay $1$ dollar each. These are the multiples of $25$, and there are $\\lfloor 2048/25\\rfloor$ of them.\n\nBut $125$, $250$, and so on still owe money. Get them to pay $1$ dollar each. We will gather $\\lfloor 2048/125\\rfloor$ dollars.\n\nBut $625$, $1250$, and $1875$ still owe money. Gather $1$ dollar from each, and we will get $\\lfloor 2048/625\\rfloor$ dollars.\n\nNow everybody has paid up, and we have gathered a total of $$\\lfloor 2048/5\\rfloor + \\lfloor 2048/25\\rfloor +\\lfloor 2048/125\\rfloor +\\lfloor 2048/625\\rfloor$$ dollars. That's the number of terminal zeros in $2048!$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI don't always upvote answers that are in \"competition\" with my own...but when I do, it's because it's a damn good answer!

Since we get a zero for every pair of factors $5\\cdot 2$, then the minimum of these will answer your question. More simply, $5$ happens less often as a factor (since it's bigger than $2$), so we need only count up the number of $5$'s. In particular, there's one each in $5,10,15,20$, so there are $4$ zeroes at the end.\n\nIf the problem had asked about $25!$, then there'd be $6$ zeroes--not $5$--because there are two factors of $5$ in $25$.

In this problem it\u2019s clear that soldiers are considered interchangeable: they all work at the same rate. (Recall that in some problems we have different workers working at different rates and have to keep track of the work rate of each worker. And it\u2019s the work rates that are important, because they\u2019re additive: if $A$ and $B$ have work rates of $r$ and $s$ amount of work per unit of time, then $A$ and $B$ working together have a combined work rate of $r+s$.) It\u2019s also clear the amount of work is being measured in cubic feet dug, and that cubic feet are to be considered interchangeable: they\u2019re all equally hard to dig. Finally, the basic unit of time here is the hour, since we\u2019re dealing with working days of two different lengths in hours.\n\nNow convert the initial data to basic units. We have $30$ soldiers doing the work. They dig $10$ trenches of $8\\cdot3\\cdot3$ cubic feet each, for a total of $720$ cubic feet of earth dug, and they do it in half of an $8$-hour day, or $4$ hours.\n\nAt this point we can calculate their combined work rate: $720$ cubic feet in $4$ hours is $\\frac{720}4=180$ cubic feet per hour. But that\u2019s the combined work rate of $30$ interchangeable soldiers, so each soldier is digging only $\\frac1{30}$-th of that, or $\\frac{180}{30}=6$ cubic feet per hour.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at the question (which we should have had in the backs of our minds all along as a guide to what\u2019s relevant and what\u2019s likely to be useful). We have $20$ soldiers available. We want to dig $18$ trenches, each $6\\cdot2\\cdot2$ cubic feet in size, so we want to move $18\\cdot6\\cdot2\\cdot2=432$ cubic feet of earth. Finally, we want to know how long this will take. We know that one soldier digs $6$ cubic feet per hour, so $20$ soldiers dig $20\\cdot6=120$ cubic feet per hour. It will therefore take them $\\frac{432}{120}=3.6$ hours, considerably less than one $10$-hour working day.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks for the explanation. \u2013\u00a0 Karan Oct 10 '12 at 14:59\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

What your boss is calculating is actually $$ \\int_a^b |f(x)| dx $$\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nIn my opinion, this is not really a math question. Which procedure is correct depends what you're going to do with your calculation.\n\nAs a matter of definition, the integral indeed measures the signed area (positive area minus negative area), as you suggest. So your approach is computing an approximation to the definite integral $\\int_a^b f$.\n\nBut maybe you want the total (unsigned) area. E.g. if you're going to lay concrete along (some real-world space corresponding to) the region bounded by the curve and the x-axis then surely you want the total area -- there's no such thing as negative concrete.\n\nWithout knowing what you're using the calculation for, it's impossible to say. (Essentially, you're asking us: \"Which of these is mathematically correct: $A-B+C$ or $A+B+C$?\" Of course it depends upon what you're trying to do.) I would like to think that your boss knew what the point of it all was, so without further information I guess I would trust him.\n\nIn fact, your story arouses my curiosity. I suppose you're not putting us on, but weighing paper cutouts is just about the last method I would ever think of for computing area (aren't you going to need a very sensitive scale or an awfully big piece of paper to get anywhere with this?). How long ago are we talking? What was the job? You don't have to answer these questions, but it would be interesting to know...\n\nshare|improve this answer\nMy curiosity is also roused.

Without a plausible functional form, and none of us knowing about things like splines back then (hey, I only barely learned calculus in school!), it was what was written in the \"manual\".

This is because the last node is always at the lowest level in the heap. Now, assume the root is at level $0$. Then the number of nodes at a completely filled level $i$ would be $d^i$.\n\nLet level $k$ be the last completely filled level in the heap. So the number of nodes upto (and including) level $k$ is: $$\\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{k}d^i = \\frac{d^{k+1} - 1}{d - 1}$$\n\nNow, the last node - the $n^{th}$ node - can either be the last node at level $k$, or it can be in an incomplete level $k+1$. Taking care of these two cases, it can be seen that: $$\\frac{d^{k+1} - 1}{d - 1} \\le n < \\frac{d^{k+2} - 1}{d - 1}$$ $$\\Rightarrow k\\le \\log_d(n(d-1) + 1) - 1 < k+1$$\n\nNow, equality is only if the last node is the last leaf of level $k$, which also has distance $k$ from the root. If not, that is if there is a level $k+1$, then the $\\log$ term would not be an integer, and applying the ceiling operator would give the right height of $k+1$. Thus, if the last element of the array is at position $n$, the height of the heap is: $$h = \\lceil \\log_d(nd - n + 1) \\rceil - 1$$ You can change the base of the logarithm using the change of base formula. Note that this is the same method that Yuval gives in his answer.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nA different approach is to calculate the number of points $n_d(h)$ in a saturated (maximal) $d$-ary heap of height $h$.

The derivation (found in various textbooks) depends only on the assumptions that fields are weak and matter is nonrelativistic, both of which are true for the Earth.\n\nModeling the Earth as a uniform-density sphere (not true, of course, but I don't care), we find that $g(r)=GMr/R^3$ where $R$ is the radius of the Earth. So $$ \\Delta\\Phi={GM\\over R^3}\\int_0^Rr\\,dr={GM\\over 2R}. $$ That means that $$ {\\Delta\\Phi\\over c^2}={GM\\over 2Rc^2}={1\\over 4}{R_s\\over R}. $$ Here $R_s=2GM/c^2$ is the Schwarzschild radius corresponding to the Earth's mass. Numerically, $R_s$ is about 9 mm, and $R$ is about 6400 km, so $\\Delta\\Phi/c^2=3\\times 10^{-10}$.\n\nThe sign of the effect is that clocks tick slower when they're deeper in the potential well. That is, a clock at the Earth's surface ticks 1.0000000003 times faster than one at the center.\n\n| cite | improve this answer | |\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ This seems a very simple approach, M/R define the ratio, a sort of \"density\", there is \"an order of magnitude\" (simply x10) of difference with Lubo\u0161 Motl answer, but at least both answer said time inside earth would be slower than in the surface $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0HDE May 19 '11 at 15:46\n  \u2022 2\n    $\\begingroup$ Actually, the difference is a factor of 3 ($3\\times 10^{-10}$ vs $10^{-9}$).

Of course, it's smooth. Let me assume that the Earth's mass density is uniform which is an OK estimate - up to factors of two or so.\n\nThe gravitational acceleration at distance $R$ from the center is $GM/R^2$ if $R$ is greater than the Earth's radius $R_E$. However, for smaller values of $R$, you have to use Gauss' law $$\\int d\\vec S\\cdot \\vec g \\sim GM_{inside}$$ and determine the total mass inside a smaller sphere. Because $M_{inside}$ goes like $R^3$ for $R<R_E$, and this $R^3$ is still divided by $R^2$ from $\\int d\\vec S$, it follows that the gravitational acceleration inside the Earth is pretty much proportional to $R$: $$ g(R) = g(R_E)\\cdot \\frac{R}{R_E} $$ In particular, the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's center is zero and near the center, a particle would oscillate like in a harmonic oscillator, $\\vec F\\sim -k\\vec x$.\n\nIt's also trivial to calculate the extra decrease of the gravitational potential you get if you go from the surface to the center. On the surface, the gravitational potential is $-GM/R_E$, as you know, because the derivative of $-GM/R$ over $R$ gives the right acceleration. However, the potential is getting even more negative. If you integrate $g(R_E)\\cdot R/R_E$ over $R$ from $0$ to $R_E$, you will get $g(R_E) R_E/2$. This has to be taken with the negative sign.\n\nSo the potential at the center, assuming uniformity, is $$ \\Phi = -\\frac{GM}{R_E} - g(R_E) \\frac{R_E}{2} = -\\frac 32 \\frac{GM}{R_E} = -\\frac 32 g(R_E) R_E $$ This gravitational potential determines the slowing of time, too. In SI units, $g(R_E)=10$ Newtons per meter and $R_E=6,378,000$. The product, with the $3/2$ factor added, is almost exactly $10^{8}$. Divide it by $c^2=10^{17}$ to get about $10^{-9}$ - the relative red shift from the center of the Earth to infinity.\n\nIf you spend 1 billion years at the center of the Earth, your twin brother outside the gravitational field will get 1 billion and one years older. If you wish, you may interpret it by saying that it's healthy to live at the center of the Earth. Good luck.\n\n| cite | improve this answer | |\n  \u2022 4\n    $\\begingroup$ A small note: the question asks about the relative time dilation between the center and surface of the Earth, whereas the $\\Phi$ you calculate is the potential of the center relative to infinity. That accounts for the factor of 3 difference between your answer and mine. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Ted Bunn May 19 '11 at 17:32\n\nThe CENTER of the earth will not have more gravity, but less. This is because half the mass will be \"above\" half \"below\" ( Regardless of orientation)...Sort of less g and in different direction/vectors. The thing is mass is not concentrated at a spot in the center with more and more g as one moves closer to the center. As you tunneled down, some of the mass, more and more would be behind you). More time dilation on surface... Where g is stronger. Time would not be slower at center of earth.\n\n| cite | improve this answer | |\n  \u2022 3\n    $\\begingroup$ Time dilation depends on the potential, not the field. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0user4552 May 20 '13 at 22:00\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ While I understand you mean potential as distance from source, and your point that there is no dilation unless this potential is not the same for the two clocks.

If we started at $a[1][j]$, we have two choices:\n\n  \u2022 continue along row $1$ : we then go to $a[1][j+1]$ with $m-1$ remaining consecutive steps that we can take along row $1$. (note here that $a[2][j+1]$ is not yet visited, maintaining the invariant).\n\n  \u2022 switch to row $2$ : we go to $a[2][j]$, incurring a cost of $a[2][j]$, and then have only one choice from there - to go to $a[1][j+1]$. Because we have switched rows, we can now refresh our count and take $k$ consecutive steps along row $2$. (note again that we haven't visited $a[1][j+1]$ yet).\n\nNow if we calculate our subproblems starting from $j = n$ towards $j=1$ for every value of $m$, you shall have your answer in $C(1, \\ 1, \\ k)$.\n\nI shall leave the base cases and runtime analysis to you.

How much heat has been added to the river by the change in gravitational potential energy in the rivet-Earth system? Also, the river absorbs the heat of the rivet with virtually no temperature change (it's large enough to serve as a \"heat reservoir\"), so what is the change in the entropy of the river from that?\n\n    So there is the entropy change of the cooling rivet plus the entropy change from the change in mechanical energy plus the entropy change from the heat transfer from rivet to river.\n  4. Aug 14, 2011 #3\n    Thanks for the reply.\n\n    So, as I see it, so far I've worked out the decrease in the entropy of the rivet.\n\n    The heat flowing into the reservoir from the rivet cooling will be the same as the heat loss from the rivet:\n\n\n    That gives me 17250 J.\n\n    Then, if we assume the temperature of the reservoir doesn't change, then, using the temperature of the river in Kelvins for T:\n\n\n    That gives me an increase of entropy in the river as 62.1 JK-1\n\n    Finally, the change in gravitational potential energy is:\n\n\n    If we assume that this is all converted to heat in the river we can work out a second component for the increase in entropy. I get S = 0.13 JK-1.\n\n    Overall this gives me a net increase in the entropy of the universe as S = 21.93 JK-1.\n\n    Is this the right track or have I completely messed up?\n  5. Aug 14, 2011 #4\n\n\n    User Avatar\n    Homework Helper\n\n    I agree with those results to the first decimal place (since I rounded off only at the end), so we get a net increase in entropy for the \"universe\" of 21.9 J/K .\n\n    It is a reasonable safe assumption that just about all of the potential energy change is transferred into heating the river. The \"splash\" at impact displaces water and ejects some of it upward (briefly), as well as producing (a minute amount of) acoustical energy. But since practically all the water falls back into the river, that mechanical energy winds up heating the river after all. (We can extend \"the universe\" to include the air over the river, but the tiny amounts of water scattered as microdroplets and vapor and of sound energy probably contribute additions to entropy scarcely worth pursuing...)\n\nSimilar Discussions: Entropy change of a hot, falling object\n  1.

The first two are in the principal genus, but they are not opposites, one is $-1$ times the other; in particular, they get diffeent positive primes, although both do residues $\\pmod 5$ and $\\pmod {41}.$ For $\\langle 1, 13, -9 \\rangle$ we get $$ 1,5,59,131,139,241,269,271,359,409, \\ldots, $$ while for $\\langle -1, 13, 9 \\rangle$ we get $$ 31,41,61,251,349,379,389,401,419,431, \\ldots. $$\n\nFor positive forms, low class number, there are polynomials, such as in Cox's book, such that primes represented by the principal form are those for which the polynomial factors a certain way. For a prime $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3,$ Gauss showed that $2$ is a cubic residue if an only if $p = u^2 + 27 v^2.$ Jacobi showed that $3$ is a cubic residue if an only if $p = u^2 + uv + 61 v^2.$ All I found in Henri Cohen's tables was the fact that $\\mathbb Q(\\sqrt {205})$ has class number $2$ and $L_K = \\mathbb Q(\\sqrt 5),$ appendix 12C on pages 533 and 534. See related information at IT'S A LINK.\n\nLet's see, $34$ is the smallest number where it is a surprise that there is no solution to $x^2 - 34 y^2 = -1.$ The smallest such odd number is $205,$ as there is no solution to $x^2 - 205 y^2 = -1.$ For prime $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4,$ there is always a solution to $x^2 - p y^2 = -1.$ Proof in Mordell's book. Anyway, this is why $\\langle 1, 13, -9 \\rangle, \\; \\langle -1, 13, 9 \\rangle$ are distinct classes.\n\nSo, that is the question, can I distinguish the represented (positive) primes by factoring some polynomial mod these primes?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 13 down vote accepted\n\nClass field theory promises such a polynomial (more properly, such a number field $H$, since a polynomial generating $H$ might have to err on the first few primes, though in our case it turns out there's a polynomial with no exceptional primes). The proof is effective, though the recipe is often hard to carry out. So I attempted an end run by asking this database for number fields of degree $8$ and discriminant $205^4$, and was rewarded with $$ x^8 + 15 x^6 + 48 x^4 + 15 x^2 + 1, $$ which generates an unramified normal extension $H \\, / \\, {\\bf Q}(\\sqrt{205})$ with the right Galois group. This polynomial matches your list exactly: the gp code\n\n   f = factormod(x^8+15*x^6+48*x^4+15*x^2+1, p)[,1];\n\nreturns your 5, 59, 131, 139, 241, 269, 271, 359, 409, and then continues 541, 569, 599, 661, 701, 761, 859, 881, 911, 941, still in exact agreement with the list of primes represented by $u^2 + 13uv - 9v^2$.\n\n[added later] That gp code checks whether all factors of $P_8(x) := x^8 + 15 x^6 + 48 x^4 + 15 x^2 + 1 \\bmod p$ have degree $1$. Since the polynomial is Galois, it would have been sufficient to check that one factor is linear:\n\n   if(poldegree(factormod(x^8+15*x^6+48*x^4+15*x^2+1, p)[1,1])==1, print(p))\n\n(I \"cheated\" a tad by excluding $p=2$, which is a factor of the discriminant of $P_8$ but not of the number field.) The Galois group of $P_8$ is dihedral, so one can find a quartic polynomial $P_4$ with the same Galois closure that factors completely mod $p$ iff $P_8$ does; such a polynomial was exhibited by NAME_IN_CAPS answering the follow-up Question 171846. Alternatively, we know already that $p$ is (either $5$ or) a quadratic residue of both $5$ and $41$, so by Quadratic Reciprocity $5$ and $41$ have square roots mod $p$, which means that $p$ factors completely in ${\\bf Q}(\\sqrt{5},\\sqrt{41})$. And indeed $x^2$ generates that field and equals (some conjugate of) $$ -\\frac14 (15 + 3 \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{41} + \\sqrt{205}); $$ so you can also test whether $p$ is represented by $u^2 + 13uv - 9v^2$ by computing $\\sqrt{5} \\bmod p$ and $\\sqrt{41} \\bmod p$ (if they don't exist then there's no representation), and then testing whether $-(15 + 3 \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{41} + \\sqrt{205})$ is a square mod $p$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nFor the very similar discriminant 221 and $x^2 + 13 x y - 13 y^2, $ I was surprised to find that $$ f(x) = x^8 + x^6 - 4 x^5 - 38 x^4 - 2 x^3 + 123 x^2 -34 x + 17, $$ has a repeated root $\\pmod {101},$ although still linear factors, seven of them with one of them squared. Is that allowed? After that it is always 8 roots. This time the primes are $ 17,101,103,127,179,251,263,373,433,$ \u2013\u00a0 Will Jagy Jun 15 at 20:47\nFor 221, the quartic $$ x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 2 x + 4 $$ behaves well \u2013\u00a0 Will Jagy Jun 15 at 20:57\nThe repeated root mod $101$ is an example of my warning that \"a polynomial generating [the Hilbert class field] $H$ might have to err on the first few primes\" if $H$ has no generator $x$ such that ${\\bf Z}[x]$ is the full ring of integers of $H$. A better choice for this purpose is $x^8 + 34 x^6 + 83 x^4 + 34 x^2 + 1$, which has spurious repeated roots only mod $2$ and $3$ (and as it happens no linear factors modulo either of these primes). Then $x+1/x$ generates a quartic isomorphic with the one you found with coefficients $1,1,1,2,4$. \u2013\u00a0 Noam D. Elkies Jun 15 at 22:14\nCool. Thanks, Noam. That does look much better.

It is interesting to note that this fails if you drop the simply connectedness assumption on $X$ or $Y$. Let's do $X$ not simply connected. Let $X$ be any connected acyclic CW-complexes with non-trivial fundamental group (these exist, see e.g. Hatcher). Then $X \\to pt$ is a homology equivalence, but not a homotopy equivalence. Since suspension raises the connectedness, the induced map $\\Sigma X \\to \\Sigma pt$ is a homology equivalence of simply connected CW-complexes and using Whitehead's theorem from Andreas' answer, this is a homotopy equivalence. \u2013\u00a0 skupers Nov 22 '10 at 23:19\n\n5 Answers 5\n\nup vote 17 down vote accepted\n\nWhitehead's Theorem (it is Corollary 4.33 in Allen Hatcher's book) says that a map between simply connected CW-complexes is a homotopy equivalence if and only if the induced map on homology (with $\\mathbb Z$-coefficients) is an isomorphism. If $\\Sigma f : \\Sigma X \\to \\Sigma Y$ is a homotopy equivalence, then this is clearly the case, since suspension just shifts dimensions and the spaces are connected, so that there is no problem in dimension $0$.\n\nIt would be interesting to have an argument which does not use all the machinery that goes into Whitehead's Theorem, since your assumption is rather strong.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nAndreas, which Whitehead's theorem is that?

It can be shown without homology that for simply-connected spaces (you can do slightly better by imposing conditions on $\\pi_1$), the connectivity of the fiber is precisely one more than the connectivity of the cofiber. You can measure the connectivity of a map using cofibers rather than fibers in this case. \u2013\u00a0 Jeff Strom Nov 22 '10 at 12:52\n\nSince adequate answers to the question asked have been given, I will address the relevant underlying theorems. There are two relevant theorems, both called ``Whitehead's theorem''. One says that a weak homotopy equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence. The other says that an integral homology isomorphism between suitable spaces, say nilpotent but it actually holds a little more generally, is a weak homotopy equivalence; I say weak because that is what comes naturally out of the proof. I observed in \"The dual Whitehead theorems'', #47 on my web page, that these two theorems are word for word Eckmann-Hilton dual to each other when thought of in the right homotopical way (this was presented at a birthday conference for Hilton). The idea is that you study $[X,Y]$ by decomposing $X$ using cells to get the first theorem and decompose $Y$ using \"cocells'', via (generalized) Postnikov towers, to get the second. This point of view is explained more leisurely in \"More concise algebraic topology\", by Kate Ponto and myself: it dominates our treatment of localizations and completions of spaces. It is an especially precise application of the intuition of model category theory, but it is best understood when worked out directly, without invoking that language.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nIf the spaces are simply connected, or somewhat more generally, if they are simple (meaning that $\\pi_1$ is abelian and acts trivially on the higher homotopy groups) then as Andreas points out, there is Whitehead's theorem that a homology isomorphism between simple spaces is a weak equivalence, and also Whitehead's other theorem that a weak equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nHowever, as rpotrie's example indicates, with non-simple spaces the question is more interesting, and the answer is that there are certainly examples where the suspension is a homotopy equivalence but the map itself is not.\n\nHere's a way to construct such a map. Let $G$ be group containing a nontrivial perfect normal subgroup $H$ (i.e., $H= [H,H]$) let $X=BG$, and let $Y=BG^+$ - Quillen's plus construction. The plus construction attaches 2 cells and 3 cells to a space to produce a new space with the same homology but with fundamental group now the quotient of the original fundamental group by $H$. The inclusion $BG \\subset BG^+$ is a homology isomorphism, but the spaces have different fundamental groups so the inclusion is not a homotopy equivalence. However, if $H$ happens to be the whole commutator subgroup and you suspend the map once then $\\Sigma BG$ and $\\Sigma (BG^+)$ are both simply connected, and so Whitehead's theorems tell you that the map is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nActually, I think it's enough that the space be nilpotent. If I remember well, a theorem of Drozd generalizing Whitehead's says that if $f\\colon X\\rightarrow Y$ is a map of connected nilpotent CW-complexes inducing isomorphism on $\\pi_1$ and $H_n$, $n\\geq 2$, then it is a homotopy equivalence. \u2013\u00a0 Fernando Muro Feb 19 '13 at 13:04\nSorry, I meant Dror, Emmanuel Dror Farjoun. \u2013\u00a0 Fernando Muro Feb 19 '13 at 17:50\n\nLook at the double suspension theorem, it asserts that the double suspension of the homology $3$-sphere of Poincare is homeomorphic to the 5-sphere.\n\nI believe that there is a map from $S^3$ to this homology sphere, I guess that the double suspension of this map may be a homotopy equivalence, I am not sure about this, but this can help.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nYour homology sphere will not be simply connected. \u2013\u00a0 Andreas Thom Nov 22 '10 at 12:31\nThere is a map from $S^3$ to the Poincare homology sphere $P$ ($S^3$ is its universal covering) and there is a map $P\\rightarrow S^3$ ($P$ can be constructed usin a dodecahedron identifying some faces. Collapsing the whole boundary gives $S^3$ and the map). I guess it is better to consider the latter map (but it is just a feeling). \u2013\u00a0 HenrikR\u00fcping Nov 22 '10 at 12:33\nAlternatively, you can delete a point the homology sphere to get a space with trivial homology and nontrivial fundamental group. \u2013\u00a0 Ben Wieland Nov 22 '10 at 12:38\n@Andreas: You are right, I've missed that hypothesis. I hadn't seen your answer when I wrote mine, it is clear from your answer the need for simple conectedeness. @Henrik: I think you are right, with the first map, the induced map of the one I say will have degree greater than one, yours seems to have degree one (after taking double suspension) which is enough to be homotopic to the identity by Hopf theorem. \u2013\u00a0 rpotrie Nov 22 '10 at 12:47\n\nI liked very much the comment/answer of Jeff Strom. And this result seems to be, indeed, essentialy, a consequence of what he mentioned. At first glance, the result seems to be a consequence of the relative Hurewicz isomorphism (and, obviously, Whitehead theorem). But we can prove the result using homotopy excision without passing to homology.\n\nAssuming $\\Sigma f $ is a weak equivalence between simply connected spaces, we get, by the homotopy excision (pag 81, May's Concise Course), that $\\Sigma C_f\\equiv C_{\\Sigma f} $ is weakly equivalent to a point. Now, we complete by induction. We already know that $f$ is a $1$-equivalence. By induction, we assume that $ f $ is a $n$-equivalence. And, again, by homotopy excision, we know that this hypothesis implies that $(M_f,X)\\to C_f $ is $(n+2)$-equivalence. So $C_f$ is $n$ connected. And, then, by Freudenthal theorem, $\\Sigma :\\pi_q( C_f)\\to \\pi _{q+1}(\\Sigma C_f) $ is an isomorphism for $q< 2n+1 $. In particular, $C_f$ is $2n$-connected. Therefore, by the $(n+2)$-equivalence, we conclude that $f$ is a $(n+2)$-connected space. And this concludes our induction.\n\nConcisely, this proof is about two lemmas: one is that commented by Jeff Strom (which can be proved using excision). The other lemma is a consequence of Freudenthal/excision: If $\\sum X $ is $n$-connected and $X$ is simply connected, then $X$ is $n-1$ connected.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

You also have to specify the elements above the diagonal. How many of those are there?

You have a vector space $V$ whose elements $-$ the actual vectors in $V$ $-$ are $n\\times n$ symmetric matrices. Each matrix is one vector in $V$.

For the remaining $n(n-1)$ entries, we need exactly $\\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ elements in the basis to in order to span those entries (due to the fact that $a_{ij}=a_{ji}$).

Then define $$ M_{ij} = T_{ij}+T_{ij}^\\text t $$ where $i$ and $j$ range over $1,2,\\dots, n$. Then for a given $n\\times n$ symmetric matrix $A$, we can write it as $$ A = \\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{1+\\delta_{ij}}{2}(A)_{ij}M_{ij} $$ where $(A)_{ij}$ denotes the $(i,j)^\\text{th}$ entry of the given matrix $A$.

Nov 28, 2003 #2\n\n    Are you trying to say something about a pipeline with a wider beginning and a narow end. The water is flowing from the wider end to the narrower end.\n\n    If this is the problem, then u can use bernoulli's theorem,\n    The total energies at both the ends are the same.\n\n    i.e the sum of pressure energy, kinetic energy and potential energy is constant throughout the flow.\n\n    in other words:\n\n    [tex](p^2)/w + gh + (v^2)/2g [/tex] is always a constant. Assuming that flow is downwards in the problem, the height of the 1m openong is 3 m and that of the 150mm end is 0. So using this find the total energy on each side and equate them. Since the same fluid is flowing w-the sp.density is the same. p is the pressure. At the opening the pressure = air pressure.\n    v is the velocity. To find the value of v at both the ends (or atleast cancel out the v term in the equation) u need to use the continuity equation A1*v1 = A2*v2. Using this find, v1/v2, substitute the other values and then find the value of the pressure at the other end.\n\n    Got it???\n\n  4.

The pressure (static and velocity are the same for the various cases you could do here, conveniently) at the bottom is simply the weight density of water times the height. Technically, thats the static pressure, but if the water is flowing, the static pressure at the bottom of the tank is equal to the velocity pressure. So from that you can caluclate the velocity of the water and the flowrate."}

Hence the face meeting $A$ and $B$ at $p$ has the same angles as the one meeting $A$ and $B$ at $q$. Therefore $p$ and $q$ are of the same type.

By Steinitz's Theorem fullerenes which exist as graphs can be realized by convex polyhedra. Branko Grunbaum and Theodore Motzkin showed, The number of hexagons and the simplicity of geodesics on certain polyhedra, Canadian J.

Now you can glue them together along the removed hexagons (matching up pentagonal and hexagonal faces), forming a new polyhedron with 3 and 4-valent vertices and considerably less symmetry than what you started with. Continuing, you could make long rod-shaped polyhedra, or you could make some spiky polyhedron by replacing multiple hexagons with other truncated icosahedra.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThese are cool molecules! \u2013\u00a0 Victor Protsak Jun 23 '10 at 8:23\n\nLemma: In a polyhedron of this type with polygons $A$ and $B$ sharing an edge $e$, the two other polygons meeting $e$ must have the same number of sides.\n\nProof: By local symmetry reflecting through the perpendicular bisector of $e$, the angles are equal.\n\nSergei Ivanov proved the same lemma in the comments.\n\nSince 5 is odd, all of the polygons around a pentagon must have the same number of sides, since you can't have a nonconstant alternating sequence. So, the only possibilities are that all polygons are pentagons, or that each pentagon is surrounded by hexagons, and each of these hexagons is surrounded by 3 pentagons and 3 hexagons. In the latter case, attaching pentagonal pyramids to each pentagon extends each hexagon into an equilateral triangle, producing a polyhedron whose faces are equilateral triangles with 5 meeting at a vertex, an icosahedron, so the original was a truncated icosahedron.\n\nNote that if you have equilateral triangles and squares meeting 4 to a vertex, then there are two possibilities for 3 squares and 1 triangle at a vertex, one with cubic symmetry and one with only dihedral symmetry with a belt which is an octagonal prism.\n\nBy contrast, if you require that there are 3 congruent triangles meeting at a vertex, but drop the regularity assumption, you get a family of disphenoids, which generically have the Klein 4-group as symmetries and no reflective symmetry.

My partial excuses are that first, the function below packages things a bit differently and closer to the syntax of MapAt itself, second, it is a bit more general and has an option to use with Listable function, and third, I am reproducing my solution from the past Mathgroup thread for exactly this question, which is more than 2 years old, so I am not plagiarizing :)\n\nSo, here is the function:\n\nOptions[mapAt] = {MappedListable -> False}; \nmapAt[f_, expr_, {pseq : (All | _Integer) ..}, OptionsPattern[]] := \n  Module[{copy = expr}, \n    copy[[pseq]] = \n      If[TrueQ[OptionValue[MappedListable]] && Head[expr] === List, \n        f /@ copy[[pseq]] \nmapAt[f_, expr_, poslist_List] := MapAt[f, expr, poslist]; \n\nThis is the same idea as what @Mr. Wizard used, with these differences: 1. In case when the spec is not of the prescribed form, regular MapAt will be used automatically 2. Not all functions are Listable. The solution of @Mr.Wizard assumes that either a function is Listable or we want to apply it to the entire list. In the above code, you can specify this by the MappedListable option.\n\nI will also borrow a few examples from my answer in the above-mentioned thread:\n\nIn[18]:= mat=ConstantArray[1,{5,3}];\n\nIn[19]:= mapAt[#/10&,mat,{All,3}]\nOut[19]= {{1,1,1/10},{1,1,1/10},{1,1,1/10},{1,1,1/10},{1,1,1/10}}\n\nIn[20]:= mapAt[#/10&,mat,{3,All}]\nOut[20]= {{1,1,1},{1,1,1},{1/10,1/10,1/10},{1,1,1},{1,1,1}}\n\nTesting on large lists shows that using Listability improves the performance, although not so dramatically here:\n\nIn[28]:= largemat=ConstantArray[1,{150000,15}];\n\nIn[29]:= mapAt[#/10&,largemat,{All,3}];//Timing\nOut[29]= {0.203,Null}\n\nIn[30]:= mapAt[#/10&,largemat,{All,3},MappedListable->True];//Timing\nOut[30]= {0.094,Null}\n\nThis is likely because for the above function (#/10&), Map (which is used internally in mapAt for the MappedListable->False (default) setting, was able to auto-compile. In the example below, the difference is more substantial:\n\nf[x_] := 2 x - 1;\n\nIn[54]:= mapAt[f,largemat,{All,3}];//Timing\nOut[54]= {0.219,Null}\n\nIn[55]:= mapAt[f,largemat,{All,3},MappedListable->True];//Timing\nOut[55]= {0.031,Null}\n\nThe point is that, while f was not declared Listable, we know that its body is built out of Listable functions, and thus it can be applied to the entire list - but OTOH it can not be auto-compiled by Map. Note that adding Listable attribute to f would have been completely wrong here and would destroy the purpose, leading to mapAt being slow in both cases.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nHow can I not vote for this? You always bring a deeper analysis to the table.

Yours in certainly an interesting take on it.

To see this, let's consider the coefficients $b_n$ of $p(x) A(r(x))$ as functions of the $a_n$, the coefficients of $A(x)$. Since $r(0) = 0$ (as it must be) we see that:\n\n  \u2022 Each $b_n$ is a linear combination of $a_0, \\dots, a_n$; i.e. we have an upper-triangular infinite matrix $F$, not depending on $a_n$, such that (writing $\\vec{a} = (a_n), \\vec{b} = (b_n)$) $\\vec{b} = F \\vec{a}$. Suppose for now that $p(0), r'(0) \\neq 0$; then $F$ has a nonzero diagonal, and so is invertible.\n\n  \u2022 If $\\vec{b} \\geq 0$ for all $\\vec{a} \\geq 0$, then in particular this is true of the columns of $F$, taking $\\vec{a}$ to be infinite \"basis\" vectors. Conversely, we have equivalently that $\\vec{a} = F^{-1} \\vec{b}$, so if $\\vec{a} \\geq 0$ for all $\\vec{b} \\geq 0$ this must be true of the columns of $F^{-1}$. We conclude that both $F$ and $F^{-1}$ have nonnegative entries.\n\n  \u2022 Lemma in linear algebra: if $F$ is upper-triangular and both it and $F^{-1}$ have nonnegative real entries, then $F$ is diagonal. Proof by induction: true for $1 \\times 1$ matrices vacuously. In general, by induction we may assume that the upper-left and lower-right $(n - 1) \\times (n - 1)$ blocks of $F$ are diagonal, so only the $(1,n)$ entry of $F$ is nonzero off the diagonal. Then we have $(F^{-1})_{1n} = -F_{1n} F_{nn}/F_{11}$. Since $F_{11}$ and $F_{nn}$ are both positive, $F_{1n}, (F^{-1})_{1n} \\geq 0$ implies $F_{1n} = 0$.\n\n  \u2022 This is also true of infinite matrices, since we can compute the finite upper-left blocks independently of the rest of the matrix.\n\n  \u2022 However, if $F$ is diagonal then we see that $p(x)A(r(x)) = \\sum a_n p(x) r(x)^n = \\sum F_{nn} a_n x^n$ for all choices of $a_n$, so (for example, taking $a_n = t^n$ for a new variable $t$ and rewriting both sides as power series in $t$) we have $p(x) r(x)^n = F_{nn} x^n$ for all $n$ (and some $F_{nn} > 0$). That is, $(r(x)/x)^n = F_{nn} p(x)^{-1}$ for all $n$, so in fact $r(x)/x = F_{11}/F_{00}$ is constant, and finally, $p(x)$ is constant as well.\n\n  \u2022 Now we remove the assumptions that $p(0), r'(0) \\neq 0$. If $x^k$ divides $p(x)$, then replacing $p(x)$ by $p(x)/x^k$ does not change positivity of the coefficients. Now suppose the bottom exponent of $r(x)$ is $x^m$ with positive coefficient; then in $\\mathbb{R}[[x]]$ we can write $r(x) = s(x)^m$, and if we denote $A_m(x) = A(x^m)$, we have $A(r(x)) = A_m(s(x))$. Clearly, $A_m$ has nonnegative coefficients if and only if $A$ does, and $s'(0) \\neq 0$, so the previous proof applies and $s(x)$ is a multiple of $x$, i.e. $r(x)$ is a multiple of $x^m$, and $p(x)$ is a multiple of $x^k$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nRyan, thank you very much for your computation (it will take time for me to follow it in details). I took $p_0=r_1=q(x)=1$, so that $p(x)=1+x$, $r(x)=x-x^2$, and computed $p(x)A(r(x))$ for $A=\\sum_{j=0}^4a_jx^j$. The coefficient of $x^8$ in the resulting polynomial is $-3a_4<0$. \u2013\u00a0 Wadim Zudilin Jul 22 '10 at 6:04\nHmmm. Looking back over the argument I realize that it is not possible for $F$ to be diagonal, since that would necessitate $p(x) r(x)^n \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ for all $n$, an impossibility.

It is not hard to see that this is impossible if there exists some $i$ such that for all $j \\ge i$, the coefficients of $p(x) r(x)^j$ are all positive after the first positive coefficient. (This occurs, for example, whenever $p, r$ themselves have this property.) This is because by induction one can take $A(x) = a_i x^i - x^{i+1} + a_{i+2} x^{i+2} + ...$ where $a_i, a_{i+2}, ... $ can be chosen to be large enough so that $p(x) A(r(x)) \\ge 0$. In general some weird things happen that you might be able to fix with the Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem, and I suspect that when $r$ is a polynomial it should always be possible to find a counterexample.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks a lot, Qiaochu! I didn't have your argument to exclude the \"eventually\" positive ($j\\ge i$) case of $p(x)r(x)^j$, but of course I suspect that only \"trivial\" pairs $p(x),r(x)$ do the job. I am just wondering whether the problem was studied... Can you provide some details on what do you mean by the SML theorem? \u2013\u00a0 Wadim Zudilin Jul 18 '10 at 2:44\nIf r is not a polynomial, the coefficients of p(x) r(x)^j will be nonzero infinitely often for sufficiently large j. Unfortunately, they can also be zero infinitely often, so changing the coefficients of A isn't necessarily enough to give you control over the coefficients of p(x) A(r(x)). The SML theorem tells you what kind of control you have and I think one could argue as above, but more carefully. \u2013\u00a0 Qiaochu Yuan Jul 18 '10 at 2:55\n\nYour Answer"}

Thanks for your careful reading! \u2013\u00a0dan8394 Jun 22 '12 at 16:35\nThanks, and no problem. \u2013\u00a0Ragib Zaman Jun 22 '12 at 16:35\n\nSuppose you have a finite field extension $\\mathbb Q \\subset K$ and an irreducible polynomial $P \\in K[X]$.\n\nLet $L$ be the Galois closure of $K$, $G$ be the Galois group of $\\mathbb Q \\subset L$, and $H$ be the subgroup of $G$ fixing $K$. Then $G$ acts on $L[X]$ by $\\sigma(\\sum a_i X^i) = \\sum \\sigma(a_i)X^i$, and $H$ is still the subgroup of $G$ fixing $K[X]$.\n\nThen define $\\tilde{P} = \\prod_{\\sigma \\in G/H} \\sigma(P)$. For any $\\sigma$ in $G$, $\\sigma(\\tilde{P}) = \\tilde P$, thus $\\tilde P \\in \\mathbb Q[X]$, and I think it should be irreducible over $\\mathbb Q$ if $K$ is the extension generated by the coefficients of $P$. And so far, the computation is polynomial in the degree of the extension $\\mathbb Q \\subset L$ (which may be exponential in the degree of $K$) and in the degree of $P$.\n\nIf you don't know exactly what $L$ and $G$ are but you know the set of conjugates $C_i$ of each coefficient $a_i$ of $P$, define $$\\tilde P = \\prod_{(b_0, \\ldots, b_n) \\in C_0 \\times \\ldots \\times C_n} (b_0 + b_1 X + \\ldots b_n X^n)$$ This will produce a polynomial in $\\mathbb Q[X]$, but can be extremely larger than the minimal polynomial.\n\nHere you pick one conjugate for each coefficient, and you do the product for all possible simultaneous choices of those conjugates. If you have one coefficient with 2 conjugates and another one with 3, and all the other coefficients are rationals, then you have 6 polynomials to multiply.\n\nFinally, if you don't know the conjugates of the coefficients but you know some annihilating polynomial for each coefficient, let $C_i$ be a set of formal roots of those polynomials, and formally expand that product. You will get an expression involving the formal roots symmetrically so you can write it using the elementary symmetric polynomials of those roots, and then use the Viete relations and replace those with the corresponding coefficients of your annihilating polynomials.\n\nHowever, these two methods can be exponential in the degree of $P$, so you should avoid them if possible.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, the Galois group of $\\mathbb Q \\subset K$ will be $S_n$, meaning that we have to do calculations in a very big field extension.\n\nsuppose $K$ is of degree $n$ and $P$ is of degree $d$. We can estimate of the generic formula you need to use to transform $P$ into a polynomial with rational coefficients.\n\nPick $L = \\mathbb Q(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)$, let $Z_1, \\ldots, Z_n$ be the elementary symmetric polynomials in $Y_i$, pick $K_0 = L^{S_n} = \\mathbb Q(Z_1, \\ldots, Z_n)$, and $K = K_0(Y_1)$ So the extension $K_0 \\subset K$ is the \"generic\" extension of degree $n$ over $\\mathbb Q$. Then say $P = \\sum a_i X^i$, where $a_i \\in K = K_0[Y_1]$ and are of degree $ < n$. So you can write $P = \\sum b_{i,j} X^i Y_1^j$ where $b_{i,j} \\in K_0$, and $(i,j) \\in \\{0 \\ldots d \\} \\times \\{0 \\ldots n \\}$. Add indeterminates $B_{i,j}$, so that now $P$ is an element of $K[B_{i,j},X]$. We can compute the product $\\prod_{k=1}^n P(Y_k,B_{i,j},X)$ in $L[B_{i,j},X]$, then since it is symmetric, write it as an element of $K_0[B_{i,j},X]$. In fact since the coefficients of $P$ are polynomials in $Y_1$ with integer coefficients, this will be a polynomial in $\\mathbb Z[Z_i, B_{i,j},X]$ of degree $dn$ in $X$, homogeneous of degree $n$ in the $B_{i,j}$.\n\nFor any choice of $n$ indeterminates among the $B_{i,j}$, $B_{i(1),j(1)} \\ldots B_{i(n),j(n)}$ will appear accompanied with $X^{i(1)+\\ldots i(n)}$ and a polynomial in $Z_k$ of degree $j(1)+\\ldots j(n) \\le n^2$ in $Y_k$. So we obtain less than about $(n+d)!/n!d! * n^{2n}/n!$ terms in the final polynomial. Though there may be a better bound on the complexity of polynomials in $Z_k$ that are of a given degree less than $n^2$ than $n^{2n}/n!$ (in particular, not all of them should be able to appear).\n\nWell the good thing it that this is polynomial in $d$ when $n$ is fixed, and is probably exponential in $n$ when $d$ is fixed. And when both of them vary, it's exponential in $d$ and $n$.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nThank you. These are some promising ideas. Can you clarify your notation in the equation?

I see no way of getting the answers you have been given. A 50 ohm resistor by itself connected to a 200 volt supply would give a 4 amp current. A parallel path through the 0.7H inductor would give a current of 0.9095 amp at 50 hz that is 90 degrees out of phase with the resistor current. You cannot simply add these two (which is effectively what you did by not calculating the equivalent impedence correctly) because they are out of phase, but even when added correctly they still add up to about 4.10 amps, which is a lot more than the answers you are given.\n\n    EDIT: Late to the party again :smile: See geosonel's reply for more detail on the calculations\n\n    Please check the problem and make sure you are stating it correctly.

Its normals are the lines through its center, that is, the lines $$y=mx+1$$ for arbitrary $m$ (this leaves out the vertical normal, but that's obviously not normal to the other curve). So now you just have to work out the values of $m$ for which the graph of $y=mx+1$ is normal to the graph of $y^2=4x$. Can you do that?\n\nI guess not, so here goes.\n\nFrom $y^2=4x$ we get $2yy'=4$, so $y'=2/y$. If $(a,b)$ is a point on the graph of $y^2=4x$, then\n1. the slope of the normal to the curve at that point is $-b/2$, and\n2. $b^2=4a$.\nSo the equation of the normal is $$y-b=-(b/2)(x-a)$$ which we can write as $$y=-(b/2)x+(1/2)ab+b$$ But we want the normal to be $y=mx+1$, so $$(1/2)ab+b=1$$ Now combining that with $b^2=4a$, we get, after a little algebra, $$b^3+8b-8=0$$ and it's easy to show that equation has exactly one real zero, so there is exactly one common normal.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nso, no real values of m.

Once we have that, finding an actual Eulerian path is of course easy.\n\nThe edges we need to double will form a set of paths each connecting two odd-degree nodes, such that each odd-degree node is the endpoint of exactly one of the path.\n\nTo find out which odd-degree nodes to connect, temporarily disregard the even-degree nodes and instead consider a graph with one edge between each pair of odd-degree nodes, its weight being the length of the shortest path between those nodes in the original graph.\n\nWhat we need to find is then a minimal perfect matching in the reduced graph, which is known to have a polynomial-time algorithm.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

A formula showing this relation would help me work out the \nprecise timbers required to construct an ellipse. I have already worked \nout a formula which I use to draw an ellipse of a given width and \nheight using two centers and a piece of string. The distance between \nthe two centers is found with the expression:\n\n   Center spacing = 2*Sqrt((Height/2)*(Height/2)*(Width/2))\n   Length of string = Height + Center spacing\n\nwhere Height is the length of the long axis of the ellipse and Width \nis the length of the short axis.\n\nDate: 08/09/98 at 09:16:33\nFrom: Doctor Jerry\nSubject: Re: Ellipse geometry\n\nHi Simon,\n\nLet's see if I understand your problem. You have an ellipse:\n\n\nThe numbers 2a and 2b are the lengths of the major and minor axes. The \nfoci of the ellipse are at (-c,0) and (c,0), where c = sqrt(a^2-b^2). \nThe length of the string is 2a.\n\nI think 2a is what you have called width and 2b is what you have called \nheight. I don't understand your formula for center spacing. I'd say \nthat the center spacing (the distance between centers) is: \n\n   2c = 2*sqrt(a^2-b^2)\n\nI'll use what I understand, as outlined in my first paragraph. You are \nseeking a point (X,0), where -a < X < a, on the major axis, from which \na line at a specified angle d (I'll assume 0 < d < 90) will intercept \nthe ellipse at right angles to the tangent.\n\nThere is a well-known formula for the equation of the tangent line to \nthe ellipse at any point (x0,y0) of the ellipse. It is:\n\n   a^2*y0*y + b^2*x*x0 = a^2*b^2\n\nAssuming (x0,y0) is in the first quadrant, the slope of this line is\n-b^2*x0/(a^2*y0). The slope of the line K perpendicular to this line is \nthe negative reciprocal of this, namely, a^2*y0/(b^2*x0). This is the \ntangent of the angle d.\n\nThe equation of K is y-y0 = a^2*y0/(b^2*x0)(x-x0). Its x-intercept, \nwhich you want, is (set y=0):\n\n   X = x0(1-b^2/a^2) = x0(a^2-b^2)/a^2 = x0*c^2/a^2\n\nSince tan(d) = a^2*y0/(b^2*x0) and x0^2/a^2+y0^2/b^2 = 1, we can \neliminate y0:\n\n   1/x0^2 = (b^2/a^4)tan^2(d) + 1/a^2  \n\nWe now know x0 in terms of d. Put this into the equation for X and \nyou're done.\n\nPlease check this out.

I believe this is the kind of thinking needed. $\\endgroup$ Sep 20 '13 at 18:46\n\nKnowing that the weights increase monotonically from box $1$ to box $8$ allows several options to be discarded out of hand. In particular, if the groups are $A=\\{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4\\}$ and $B=\\{b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4\\}$, with $a_1<a_2<a_3<a_4$ and $b_1<b_2<b_3<b_4$ and $a_1<b_1$, then we already know the $A$'s are lighter if $a_i<b_i$ for each $i$. These ignorable configurations correspond to walks by $\\pm 1$ from $0$ to $0$ that are always non-negative: $$ 010101010 \\\\ 010101210 \\\\ 010121010 \\\\ 012101010 \\\\ 012121010 \\\\ 012101210 \\\\ 010121210 \\\\ 012321010 \\\\ 012121210 \\\\ 010123210 \\\\ 012123210 \\\\ 012321210 \\\\ 012323210 \\\\ 012343210 $$ (fourteen, or the Catalan number $C_4$) where the $A$'s are definitely lighter. (The last in this list corresponds to $A=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and $B=\\{5,6,7,8\\}$, for instance.) This leaves only $\\frac{1}{2}{{8}\\choose{4}}-14=21$ partitions to choose from. So it's quite possible that $5$ weightings are enough.\n\nIndeed, even $4$ may be enough, since a weighing may be balanced (that is, there are three possible outcomes, one of which consists of only one possibility). So ideally the first weighing would either balance or reduce us to $10$ possibilities; the second would either balance or reduce us to $5$ possibilities; the third would either balance or reduce us to $2$ possibilities; and the fourth would determine the answer.\n\n\nI would start with $1278$. If heavy, it allows you to knot that $7$ and $8$ are in different groups, if light, you know $1$ and $2$ are in different groups. Let us assume it is heavy, otherwise subtract all numbers below from $9$.\n\nThe remaining combinations that are possible are $$\\begin {array} \\\\1268&1368&1468&1568\\\\ 1258&1358&1458\\\\1248&1348\\\\1238\\\\ \\\\2368\\\\2358&2458\\\\2348\\\\ \\\\3458\\end{array}$$ where combinations above, north or east are known to be heavier. The line breaks represent layers in a 3D matrix. If we try $1358$ next, then either $1468$ or $2358$, we might need as many as four more. This gives $7$ weighings. I haven't proven that you can't do it in $6$.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ There is something I dont understand. There are 6 combinations(considering 21 valid) which has 7 and 8 on the same side.

The initial fan does not circulate enough air through the radiator to keep the engine cool during difficult conditions. First the example shows how to design an experiment to investigate the effect of three performance factors: fan distance from the radiator, blade-tip clearance, and blade pitch angle. It then shows how to estimate optimum values for each factor, resulting in a design that produces airflows beyond the goal of 875 ft3 per minute using test data. Finally it shows how to use simulations to verify that the new design produces airflow according to the specifications in more than 99.999% of the fans manufactured. This example uses MATLAB\u00ae, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox\u2122, and Optimization Toolbox\u2122.\n\nDefine the Problem\n\nThis example addresses an engine cooling fan design that is unable to pull enough air through the radiator to keep the engine cool during difficult conditions, such as stop-and-go traffic or hot weather). Suppose you estimate that you need airflow of at least 875 ft3/min to keep the engine cool during difficult conditions. You need to evaluate the current design and develop an alternative design that can achieve the target airflow.\n\nAssess Cooling Fan Performance\n\nLoad the sample data.\n\n\nThe data consists of 10,000 measurements (historical production data) of the existing cooling fan performance.\n\nPlot the data to analyze the current fan's performance.\n\nylabel('Max Airflow (ft^3/min)')\ntitle('Historical Production Data')\n\nThe data is centered around 842 ft3/min and most values fall within the range of about 8 ft3/min.

The estimate for the mean airflow speed is 841.652 ft3/min, and the 95% confidence interval for the mean airflow speed is (841.616, 841.689). This estimate makes it clear that the current fan is not close to the required 875 ft3/min. There is need to improve the fan design to achieve the target airflow.\n\nDetermine Factors That Affect Fan Performance\n\nEvaluate the factors that affect cooling fan performance using design of experiments (DOE).

Based on the experimental test results, the airflow rate is sensitive to the changing factors values. Also, four experimental runs meet or exceed the target airflow rate of 875 ft3/min (runs 2, 4,12, and 14). However, it is not clear which, if any, of these runs is the optimal one. In addition, it is not obvious how robust the design is to variation in the factors. Create a model based on the current experimental data and use the model to estimate the optimal factor settings.\n\nImprove the Cooling Fan Performance\n\nThe Box-Behnken design enables you to test for nonlinear (quadratic) effects. The form of the quadratic model is:\n\nAF\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b20+\u03b21*Distance+\u03b22*Pitch+\u03b23*Clearance+\u03b24*Distance*Pitch+\u03b25*Distance*Clearance+\u03b26*Pitch*Clearance+\u03b27*Distance2+\u03b28*Pitch2+\u03b29*Clearance2,\n\nwhere AF is the airflow rate and Bi is the coefficient for the term i. Estimate the coefficients of this model using the fitlm function from Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.\n\nmdl = fitlm(Expmt,'Airflow~D*P*C-D:P:C+D^2+P^2+C^2');\n\nDisplay the magnitudes of the coefficients (for normalized values) in a bar chart.\n\nh = bar(mdl.Coefficients.Estimate(2:10));\nset(h,'facecolor',[0.8 0.8 0.9])\nset(gcf,'units','normalized','position',[0.05 0.4 0.35 0.4])\nylabel('Airflow (ft^3/min)')\nxlabel('Normalized Coefficient')\ntitle('Quadratic Model Coefficients')\n\nThe bar chart shows that Pitch and Pitch2 are dominant factors. You can look at the relationship between multiple input variables and one output variable by generating a response surface plot. Use plotSlice to generate response surface plots for the model mdl interactively.\n\n\nThe plot shows the nonlinear relationship of airflow with pitch. Move the blue dashed lines around and see the effect the different factors have on airflow. Although you can use\u00a0plotSlice\u00a0to determine the optimum factor settings, you can also use Optimization Toolbox to automate the task.\n\nFind the optimal factor settings using the constrained optimization function fmincon.\n\nWrite the objective function.\n\nf = @(x) -x2fx(x,'quadratic')*mdl.Coefficients.Estimate;\n\nThe objective function is a quadratic response surface fit to the data. Minimizing the negative airflow using\u00a0fmincon\u00a0is the same as maximizing the original objective function. The constraints are the upper and lower limits tested (in coded values). Set the initial starting point to be the center of the design of the experimental test matrix.\n\nlb = [-1 -1 -1]; % Lower bound\t\t\t\t\t\nub = [1 1 1];    % Upper bound                       \nx0 = [0 0 0];    % Starting point\n[optfactors,fval] = fmincon(f,x0,[],[],[],[],lb,ub,[]); % Invoke the solver\nLocal minimum found that satisfies the constraints.\n\nOptimization completed because the objective function is non-decreasing in \nfeasible directions, to within the default value of the function tolerance,\nand constraints are satisfied to within the default value of the constraint tolerance.\n\nConvert the results to a maximization problem and real-world units.\n\nmaxval = -fval;\nmaxloc = (optfactors + 1)';\nbounds = [1 1.5;15 35;1 2];\nmaxloc=bounds(:,1)+maxloc .* ((bounds(:,2) - bounds(:,1))/2);\ndisp('Optimal Values:')\ndisp([maxloc' maxval])\nOptimal Values:\n    'Distance'    'Pitch'    'Clearance'    'Airflow'\n\n            1       27.275            1       882.26\n\nThe optimization result suggests placing the new fan one inch from the radiator, with a one-inch clearance between the tips of the fan blades and the shroud.\n\nBecause pitch angle has such a significant effect on airflow, perform additional analysis to verify that a 27.3 degree pitch angle is optimal.\n\ntbl = table(pitch,airflow);\nmdl2 = fitlm(tbl,'airflow~pitch^2');\nans =\n\n\nThe results show that a quadratic model explains the effect of pitch on the airflow well.\n\nPlot the pitch angle against airflow and impose the fitted model.\n\nhold on\nylim([840 885])\ntitle('Fitted Model and Data')\nxlabel('Pitch angle (degrees)') \nlegend('Test data','Quadratic model','Location','se')\nhold off\n\nFind the pitch value that corresponds to the maximum airflow.\n\nans =\n\n\nThe additional analysis confirms that a 27.3 degree pitch angle is optimal.\n\nThe improved cooling fan design meets the airflow requirements. You also have a model that approximates the fan performance well based on the factors you can modify in the design. Ensure that the fan performance is robust to variability in manufacturing and installation by performing a sensitivity analysis.\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nSuppose that, based on historical experience, the manufacturing uncertainty is as follows.\n\nFactorReal ValuesCoded Values\nDistance from radiator1.00 +/- 0.05 inch1.00 +/- 0.20 inch\nBlade pitch angle27.3 +/- 0.25 degrees0.227 +/- 0.028 degrees\nBlade tip clearance1.00 +/- 0.125 inch-1.00 +/- 0.25 inch\n\nVerify that these variations in factors will enable to maintain a robust design around the target airflow. The philosophy of Six Sigma targets a defect rate of no more than 3.4 per 1,000,000 fans. That is, the fans must hit the 875 ft3/min target 99.999% of the time.\n\nYou can verify the design using Monte Carlo simulation. Generate 10,000 random numbers for three factors with the specified tolerance. First, set the state of the random number generators so results are consistent across different runs.\n\n\nPerform the Monte Carlo simulation. Include a noise variable that is proportional to the noise in the fitted model, mdl (that is, the RMS error of the model). Because the model coefficients are in coded variables, you must generate dist, pitch, and clearance using the coded definition.\n\ndist = random('normal',optfactors(1),0.20,[10000 1]);\npitch = random('normal',optfactors(2),0.028,[10000 1]);\nclearance = random('normal',optfactors(3),0.25,[10000 1]);\nnoise = random('normal',0,mdl2.RMSE,[10000 1]);\n\nCalculate airflow for 10,000 random factor combinations using the model.\n\nsimfactor = [dist pitch clearance];\nX = x2fx(simfactor,'quadratic');\n\nAdd noise to the model (the variation in the data that the model did not account for).\n\nsimflow = X*mdl.Coefficients.Estimate+noise;\n\nEvaluate the variation in the model's predicted airflow using a histogram. To estimate the mean and standard deviation, fit a normal distribution to data.\n\npd = fitdist(simflow,'normal');\nhold on\ntext(,300,['Mean: ' num2str(round(])\ntext(,280,['Standard deviation: ' num2str(round(pd.sigma))])\nhold off\ntitle('Monte Carlo Simulation Results')\n\nThe results look promising. The average airflow is 882 ft3/min and appears to be better than 875 ft3/min for most of the data.\n\nDetermine the probability that the airflow is at 875 ft3/min or below.\n\nformat long\npfail = cdf(pd,875)\npass = (1-pfail)*100\npfail =\n\n\npass =\n\n\nThe design appears to achieve at least 875 ft3/min of airflow 99.999% of the time.\n\nUse the simulation results to estimate the process capability.\n\nS = capability(simflow,[875.0 890])\npass = (1-S.Pl)*100\nS = \n\n       mu: 8.822982645666709e+02\n    sigma: 1.424806876923940\n        P: 0.999999816749816\n       Pl: 1.509289008603141e-07\n       Pu: 3.232128339675335e-08\n       Cp: 1.754623760237126\n      Cpl: 1.707427788957002\n      Cpu: 1.801819731517250\n      Cpk: 1.707427788957002\n\npass =\n\n\nThe Cp value is 1.75. A process is considered high quality when Cp is greater than or equal to 1.6. The Cpk is similar to the Cp value, which indicates that the process is centered. Now implement this design. Monitor it to verify the design process and to ensure that the cooling fan delivers high-quality performance.\n\nControl Manufacturing of the Improved Cooling Fan\n\nYou can monitor and evaluate the manufacturing and installation process of the new fan using control charts. Evaluate the first 30 days of production of the new cooling fan. Initially, five cooling fans per day were produced. First, load the sample data from the new process.\n\n\nPlot the X-bar and S charts.\n\ncontrolchart(spcflow,'chart',{'xbar','s'}) % Reshape the data into daily sets\n\nAccording to the results, the manufacturing process is in statistical control, as indicated by the absence of violations of control limits or nonrandom patterns in the data over time. You can also run a capability analysis on the data to evaluate the process.\n\n[row,col] = size(spcflow);\nS2 = capability(reshape(spcflow,row*col,1),[875.0 890])\npass = (1-S.Pl)*100\nS2 = \n\n       mu: 8.821061141685465e+02\n    sigma: 1.423887508874697\n        P: 0.999999684316149\n       Pl: 3.008932155898586e-07\n       Pu: 1.479063578225176e-08\n       Cp: 1.755756676295137\n      Cpl: 1.663547652525458\n      Cpu: 1.847965700064817\n      Cpk: 1.663547652525458\n\npass =\n\n\nThe Cp value of 1.755 is very similar to the estimated value of 1.73. The Cpk value of 1.66 is smaller than the Cp value. However, only a Cpk value less than 1.33, which indicates that the process shifted significantly toward one of the process limits, is a concern. The process is well within the limits and it achieves the target airflow (875 ft3/min) more than 99.999% of the time."}

If you were to evaluate this with a calculator inputted like as is, the calculator would evaluate it as\u00a0\\(\\frac{6^2}{2}*3+4\\). This is because the 2(3) is really multiplication, so division takes precedence since it is\u00a0comes first in the expression. First it does 6^2, then it divides 6^2 by 2 because division is first from left to right, and then it multiplies that quantity by 3. Here is another example with a variable\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nUsing the same logic as above, this equation, in fraction form is strictly\u00a0\\(\\frac{8}{2}y\\)--not\u00a0\\(\\frac{8}{2y}\\). Some would argue, however, that 2y is a term, so it shouldn't be separated.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHow do we eliminate this ambiguity if there is no fraction button to speak of? Use parentheses!\u00a0\n\n\nAsinus's interpretation of \\(\\frac{6^2}{2*3}+4\\)\u00a0will be unambiguous once you add 1 set of parentheses with\u00a0\\(6^2/(2(3))+4\\). Now, the only correct interpretation is\u00a0\\(\\frac{6^2}{2*3}+4\\)\u00a0because the parentheses indicate that we are dividing by the quantity of the product of 2 and 3.\n\n\nThe strict interpretation is\u00a0\\(\\frac{6^2}{2}*3+4\\)\u00a0should be written like\u00a0\\((6^2/2)(3)+4\\). In this case, the quantity of six squared divided by two is all multiplied by three. No more ambiguity.\n\n\nOkay, after all of this ranting, now I will evaluate what I believe to be, under the current rules of the order of operations, the way to evaluate the expression 6^2/2(3)+4 as\u00a0\\(\\frac{6^2}{2}*3+4\\):\n\n\n\\(\\frac{6^2}{2}*3+4\\) Evaluate the numerator.\u00a0\\(6^2=36\\)\n\\(\\frac{36}{2}*3+4\\) Simplify the fraction\u00a0by recognizing that the 36 is divisible by 2 because 36 is even.\n\\(18*3+4\\) Do multiplication before addition.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheXSquaredFactor \u00a0Aug 3, 2017\n\nHello\u00a0 \\(X^2\\)\n\nNeither of us is wrong.\nRight, who puts brackets to represent the meaning of his term.\ngreetings :)\n\nasinus \u00a0Aug 4, 2017\n\nGreetings to you, too :)\n\nTheXSquaredFactor \u00a0Aug 5, 2017\n\n23 Online Users"}

Can't decide between French and English?\n\n    You have [itex]f(\\theta)= cos(\\theta)+ 0.4sin(\\theta)[/itex] (only English for me, I'm afraid.). I don't see any reason to introduce a square root just to have only sine. Taking the derivative, [itex]f'(\\theta)= -sin(\\theta)+ 0.4cos(\\theta)= 0[/itex] at a max or min. That is the same as [itex]sin(\\theta)= 0.4 cos(\\theta)[/itex] or, since sine and cosine are not 0 for the same [itex]\\theta[/itex], we must have [itex]sin(\\theta)/cos(\\theta)= tan(\\theta)= 0.4[/itex].

Jan 7, 2013 #7\n    Yes indeed, but that was easily done by deriving again and finding if the result in this particular point would be positive or negative, since I found a negative value I concluded that it was a maximum, the value I wanted(In OP I miswrote, I actually wanted a maximum initially).\n\n    [itex]tan(\\theta)= 0.4;\\theta = 21.8^o\\\\f''(21.8^o)= -1.077[/itex]\n\n    However, since you mentioned that, I just realized that I have no idea on how to find the minimum.

But tracing through it, here's where the p(T) equation comes from. For a particle (using c = 1), the energy is E = \u03b3m and the momentum is p = \u03b3mv. Thus p/E = v (Eq.1)\n\n    For a system of particles, the energy-momentum tensor is T\u03bc\u03bd = \u2211n pn\u03bc dxn\u03bd/dt \u03b43(x-xn), or using Eq.1, T\u03bc\u03bd = \u2211n pn\u03bc pn\u03bd/En \u03b43(x-xn\n\n    For a perfect fluid, the spatial components of T\u03bc\u03bd are related to the pressure p by Tij = p \u03b4ij.\n\n    Thus p = (1/3) \u01a9j Tjj = (1/3) \u01a9n pn2/En \u03b43(x-xn).\n\n    This gets you the p2 in the numerator, the E in the denominator, and the 1/3 out front."}

This becomes clear when you plug y back into the ODE to check if it works out. Then, with the benefit of hindsight, you could foresee this, since if y is one solution, then the other is -y and it's derivative is -y'. If you write the ODE as xyy'=x^2+y^2 you can see that if y is a solution, then -y is too.\n\n    Ofcourse, if you're given a boundary value or initial value/condition then there will be only one solution.

Let $X_0 = (x_0^1, \\ldots, x_0^N) = (S, S, \\ldots, S)$. Let $X_1 = (x_1^1, \\ldots, x_1^N)$, where $x_1^j$ is chosen uniformly at random from $0, 1, \\ldots, x_0^j-1$. Define $X_2$ similarly in terms of $X_1$, and so on.\n\nThen the sequence $(x_0^1, x_1^1, x_2^1, x_3^1, \\ldots)$ are as follows:\n\n  \u2022 $x_0^1 = L$, of course.\n  \u2022 $x_1^1$ is uniformly distributed on $\\{ 0, \\ldots, S-1 \\}$.\n  \u2022 $x_2^1$ is uniformly distributed on $\\{ 0, \\ldots, x_1^1-1 \\}$.\n\nand so on... In particular the distribution of $x_1^1$ is the distribution of number of elements in a random permutation on $S$ elements which are {\\it not} in the cycle containing 1; In particular the distribution of $x_1^1$ is the distribution of number of elements in a random permutation on $S$ elements which are {\\it not} in any of the $k$ cycles with the smallest minima.\n\nSo the distribution of the smallest $k$ for which $x_k^1 = 0$ is exactly the distribution of the number of cycles of a random permutation of $\\{ 1, \\ldots, S \\}$; this is $1 + 1/2 + \\cdots + 1/S \\sim \\log S + \\gamma$, where $\\gamma = 0.577\\ldots$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nIn the higher-dimensional cases, the time to reach $(0, \\ldots, 0)$ is just the {\\it maximum} of the number of cycles of $N$ permutations chosen uniformly at random; this should still have expectation $\\log S$ plus a constant depending on $N$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks for your answer Michael. \u2013\u00a0 Rob Grey Feb 13 '10 at 3:39\nYou're welcome! It just happens that I spend way too much time thinking about random permutations. That being said, the original problem was a little underspecified, and I happened to make the interpretations that led to me being able to solve it. In your second comment I see you actually had a different interpretation in mind. I suspect the overall behavior is the same -- still logarithmic -- but it would be harder to prove because the $N$ dimensions are no longer independent. \u2013\u00a0 Michael Lugo Feb 13 '10 at 3:50\n\nWhile I like Michael Lugo's answer better, I thought I might as well put up the solution I sketched out for myself for the one-dimensional case:\n\nThe probability that the walker visits a particular point on the one-dimensional lattice can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{||x_k||-p}$ where $p$ is the distance between the lattice point and the origin. Therefore, we can express the probability that, during a given step, the walker visits the target lattice point (i.e. the lattice point furthest from the origin) as - $P(target)$ = $\\frac{(\\frac{1}{||x_k||-(||x_k||-1)})}{\\sum_{i=0}^{\\||x_k||-1}\\frac{1}{||x_k||-i}}$. $\\frac{1}{P(target)}$ should therefore provide the average hitting time for the one-dimensional walkers under the imposed conditions.

So:\n\n     g(1) = 1\n     g(2) = 3\n     g(3) = 6\n\nand so on. You probably know that:\n\n     g(n) = n(n+1)/2\n\nLet f(n) be the sum of the triangular numbers 1 through n.\n\n     f(n) = g(1) + g(2) + ... + g(n)\n\n     f(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)/6\n\nHow can we prove this? We can prove it by induction. That is, we'll \nprove two things:\n   1) It's true for some n (n=1, in this case).\n   2) If it's true for n, then it's true for n+1.\n\nThis will allow us to conclude that it's true for all n >= 1.\n\nNow 1) is easy. We know that f(1) = g(1) = 1. So it's true for n = 1.\n\nNow for 2). Suppose it's true for n. Consider f(n+1). We have:\n\n     f(n+1) = g(1) + g(2) + ... + g(n) + g(n+1) \n            = f(n) + g(n+1)\n\nUsing our assumption that f(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)/6 and that \ng(n+1) = (n+1)(n+2)/2, we have:\n\n     f(n+1) = n(n+1)(n+2)/6 + (n+1)(n+2)/2\n            = n(n+1)(n+2)/6 + 3(n+1)(n+2)/6\n            = (n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/6\n\nwhich is exactly what the formula says it should be. Thus we have \nshown that if it's true for n, it's true for n + 1. Since we showed it \nwas true for n = 1, we now know it's also true for n = 1 + 1 = 2, and \nthen for n = 2 + 1 = 3, and so on, for all n >= 1.\n\nBy the way, these numbers (1,4,10,20,35,56,...) are known as \ntetrahedral numbers. If you imagine piling triangles of dots on top of \none another first 1, then 3, then 6, then 10 you'll get a tetrahedron \nof dots at each stage with 1,4,10,20 dots total.

When you reach or pass the original point $P_0$, leave a point $P_n$ there, and stop.\n\nIf $P_n$ and $P_0$ coincide, we are done, Otherwise, decrease $d$ continuously until they do. Now we have $n$ equally spaced points on the ellipse. And we can repreat this procedure to find $n+1$ equally spaced points, and so on.\n\nThere are two things that can go wrong:\n\n  1. This procedure works, but the ellipse is so eccentric that $P_{i-1}$ and $P_{i+1}$ are not the nearest neighbours of $P_i$ (because there is a closer point across the semi-minor axis).\n  2. For some $i$, the position of $P_i$ is not a continuous function of $d$. This can happen if $P_{i-1}$ is near the 'sharp end' of the ellipse, and the line $P_{i-1} P_i$ is normal to the ellipse at $P_i$. This can happen if, roughly, the curvature of the ellipse exceeds $\\frac{1}{2d}$ at some point.\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nPerhaps I am misinterpreting your question, as I think there is a very simple way to do this. Given the ellipse, and given $N$, take $d$ very small compared to $A/N$, pick a point on the ellipse, then going around the ellipse clockwise (say) pick points such that each is at distance $d$ from the preceding one. Locating each point is a simple matter of finding the intersection with the ellipse of a circle of radius $d$ centered at the previous point.\n\nIf this is not what you want, please clarify your question.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIf I take $d$ very small to $\\frac{A}{N}$ then won't the two terminal points won't have a nearest-neighbor distance of $<<d$? \u2013\u00a0 Ness Oct 14 '11 at 8:54\n@Ness: it may, it may not.

A practical way could be the following: Choose the points $$z_k:=\\bigl(A\\cos{2\\pi k\\over N}, B\\sin{2\\pi k\\over N}\\bigr)\\quad(0\\leq k\\leq N)$$ $(z_0=z_N)$ as starting set and update the $z_k$, $0<k<N$, recursively in the following way: Each $z_k$ is replaced by the point $z_k'$ on the arc $(z_{k-1},z_{k+1})$ which is at equal distance from $z_{k-1}$ and $z_{k+1}$. This point can be found by solving a single quadratic equation. I conjecture that this procedure converges \"linearly\" to the unique solution of the problem with $z_0=(A,0)$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nI will assume that $A$, $B$ and $N$ are given, and that $d$ is unknown.\n\nThere is always a solution. Let $L$ be the perimeter of the ellipse. An obvious constraint is $N\\,d<L$. Take $d\\in(0,L/N)$. As explained in Gerry Myerson's answer, pick a point $P_1$ on the ellipse, and then pick points $P_2,\\dots,P_N$ such that $P_{i+1}$ is clockwise from $P_i$ and the euclidean distance between $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$ is $d$. If $d$ is small, $P_N$ will be short of $P_1$, while if $d$ is large, it will \"overpass\" $P_1$. In any case, the position of $P_N$ is a continuous function of $d$. By continuity, there will be a value of $d$ such that $P_1=P_N$. It is also clear that this value is unique.\n\nTo find $P_N$ for a given $d$ you need to solve $N-1$ quadratic equations. To compute the value of $d$, you can use the bisection method.\n\nEdit: TonyK's objections can be taken care of if $N=2\\,M$ is even. Take $P_1=(A,0)$ and follow the procedure to find points $P_2,\\dots,P_{M+1}$ in the upper semiellipse such that $P_{i+1}$ is clockwise of $P_i$ and at distance $d$, and $P_{M+1}=(-A,0)$. The the sought solution is $P_1,\\dots,P_{M+1},\\sigma(P_M),\\dots,\\sigma(P_2)$, where $\\sigma(P)$ is the point symmetric of $P$ with respect to the axis $y=0$.\n\nIf $N=2\\,M+1$ is odd, I believe that there is also a symmetric solution, but I have to think about it.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nSee my answer for objections to this argument! \u2013\u00a0 TonyK Oct 14 '11 at 10:03\n@TonyK I have edited my answer. \u2013\u00a0 Juli\u00e1n Aguirre Oct 14 '11 at 11:37\nYour solution for even $M$ doesn't answer my first point. If the ellipse is flat enough, it may be that $P_{M+1}$ is closer to $P_{M-1}$ than it is to $P_M$. \u2013\u00a0 TonyK Oct 14 '11 at 11:42\nSo by symmetry we could also have $P_3$ closer to $P_1$ than $P_2$? \u2013\u00a0 Juli\u00e1n Aguirre Oct 14 '11 at 13:14\nSorry, I meant $P_{M+2}$ is closer to $P_M$ than to $P_{M+1}$.

Simply plug it into the original equation to get 2a+5(2-a/5)=20 which then gets to 20=20. so then for any a: (a,4-2a/5) will be an answer, you need both a and b to be integers. just take an a that is a multiple of 5 and you will have two integer solutions.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

What is the minimal size of a partial order that is universal for orders of size $n$?\n\nIn particular, is there a polynomial upper bound?\n\nOne can make at least slight improvements to the $2^n$ upper bound, by observing that the emptyset was not needed, as it never arises as a lower cone, and we don't need all the atoms, since if they are needed, then one can use the co-atoms instead. I suspect that there is a lot of waste in the power set order, but the best upper bound I know is still exponential.\n\nFor a lower bound, my current knowledge is weak and far from exponential. Any order that is universal for orders of size $n$ will contain a chain and an antichain, making it have size at least $2n-1$. (That bound is exact for $n\\leq 3$.) A student in my intro logic course extended this to $n\\log(n)$ by considering $k$ chains (and antichains) of size $n/k$.\n\nCan one find better lower bounds?\n\nInterestingly, the same student observed that we cannot in general expect to find unique smallest universal orders, since he found several orders of size 5 that are universal for orders of size 3 and which are minimal with that property.

For the warm-up to that theorem, we first embedded the finite powersets into the Turing degrees, and then concluded that all finite orders embed by universality. \u2013\u00a0 Joel David Hamkins May 25 '10 at 14:09\nCorrection: my student's lower bound is $n\\log(n)-n$. \u2013\u00a0 Joel David Hamkins May 25 '10 at 14:41\nadd comment\n\n2 Answers\n\nDenote by $F(n)$ the number of different partial orders on the set of cardinality $n$. Then the minimal size $N$ of a partial order that is universal for orders of size $n$ satisfies $\\binom{N}{n}\\geq F(n)$ (that's captain obvious advice, yes). Since $\\log F(n)$ behaves like $cn^2$ (the lower estimate, which we need, is proved as follows: take $n/2$ blue elements and $n/2$ red elements, then decide for each pair of red and blue elements $r_i$, $b_j$, whether $r_i > b_j$ or not. We get $2^{n^2/4}$ patial orders, each isomorphism class is counted at most $n!$ times). So, $N^n> \\binom{N}{n}\\geq F(n)$, taking logarithms we get $n\\log N > cn^2$, so $N$ should grow at least exponentially.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks very much for this excellent answer!

It is know that $P_n \\geq 2^{n^2/4}$. Thus, any method of uniquely representing the partial orders on $n$ elements, say in binary, will require at least $log_2(2^{n^2/4}) = O(n^2)$ bits.\n\nNow assume that for every $n$ there is a partial order on $n^k$, or fewer, elements, where $k$ is a constant, that is universal for the class of partial orders on $n$ elements. Fix some canonical ordering of the partial orders and let $U(n)$ be the first universal partial orders on $n^k$, or fewer elements.\n\nLabel each of the elements in $U(n)$ with a unique number from $1$ up to $log_2(f(n)) = O(log(n))$ in some fixed canonical way. Now each partial order on $n$ elements can be uniquely described by writing down for each element that elements corresponding label in $U(n)$. This takes $O(nlog(n))$ bits. However; this representation is not quite complete, as it seems to require the description of $U(n)$ to actually reconstruct a partial order given its representation in this form.\n\nHowever, since $U(n)$ is the first universal partial order on $n^k$ or fewer elements, rather than appending an encoding of $U(n)$ to each partial order directly we can instead append an encoding of the following Turing machine $M$. $M$ takes in three arguments $n$, $i$ and $j$ and accepts if element $i$ is less than element $j$ in $U(n)$ and rejects otherwise. Given such a Turing machine we can clearly reconstruct the partial order. $M$ simply enumerates all partial orders of size between $n$ and $n^k$ and stops at the first partial order that is universal for all partial orders on $n$ elements. It then labels the elements of $U(n)$ in the canonical manner and accepts if the element labeled $i$ in $U(n)$ is less than the element labeled $j$ in $U(n)$. This TM has constant size.\n\nWe can thus uniquely and completely represent all partial orders on $n$ elements by $O(nlog(n)) + O(1) = O(nlog(n))$ bits, which is a contradiction as there are too many partial orders on $n$ elements to be represented in only $O(nlog(n))$ bits.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIt is not true that $P_n \\geq 2^{n^2/4}$.

I kept my original response, and put the remaining arguments in the \"EDIT\" section below.\n\nHere is a quick proof that there are only finitely many solutions.\n\nWe use $m!=(n-3)(n^2+3n+9)$. Here $n$ is divisible by $3$, hence $n^2+3n+9$ is not divisible by any prime $p\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. In other words, all the prime divisors $p\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$ of $m!$ are contained in $n-3$ with multiplicity. It follows, with the usual notations, that\n\n$$ \\frac{\\log m!}{3}>\\log(n-3)\\geq\\sum_{p\\equiv 2 \\ (3), \\ p\\leq m}v_p(m!)\\log p> \\sum_{p\\equiv 2\\ (3), \\ p\\leq m} \\left(\\frac{m}{p}-1\\right)\\log p.$$\n\nThe left hand side is $\\sim (m\\log m)/3$, while the right hand side is $\\sim (m\\log m)/2$ by Dirichlet's theorem. Hence for large $m$ the inequality must fail.\n\nEDIT. Assume that $m\\geq 1000$, and denote by $\\chi$ the nontrivial character modulo $3$. Then $$ \\sum_{p\\leq m}\\frac{\\chi(p)\\log p}{p}<\\sum_{n\\leq m}\\frac{\\chi(n)\\Lambda(n)}{n}-\\sum_{p\\leq m,\\ p\\neq 3}\\frac{\\log p}{p^2+p}. $$ This implies, in combination with some ideas of Bordelles (cf. the proof of (4.2) here), that $$ \\sum_{p\\leq m}\\frac{\\chi(p)\\log p}{p}<3\\left|\\frac{L'(1,\\chi)}{L(1,\\chi)}\\right|+1.53<2.64\\ .$$ By including the contribution of the prime $p=3$ to $n-3$ in the original inequality, and using also some classical bounds by Rosser and Schoenfeld (cf. (3.15) and (3.21) here), it follows that $$\\frac{m(\\log m-0.9)}{3}>\\frac{m(\\log m-6.1)}{2}\\quad\\text{for}\\quad m>e^{16.5}.$$ Hence $m < e^{16.5}$. I checked with SAGE that in fact $$\\sum_{p\\leq m}\\frac{\\chi(p)\\log p}{p}<-0.63\\quad\\text{for}\\quad e^{16.5}>m>e^{7}.$$ This can be used to improve the previous bound to $$\\frac{m(\\log m-0.99)}{3}>\\frac{m(\\log m-2.92)}{2}\\quad\\text{for}\\quad e^{16.5}>m>e^{7},$$ which in turn forces $m < 1000$. The above shows that all solutions of the original equation satisfy $m < 1000$. However, I checked with SAGE that in this range the equation has no solution.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThank you so much GH, now it is interesting find an upper bound for $m$ such that we can begin a computer search. \u2013\u00a0 Roberto Bosch Cabrera May 8 '12 at 14:51\nThis problem arise (it is the hard part) when we try to solve the equation: $x!+y!+3=Z^3$ which was proposed as $J198$ in Mathematical Reflections.

You can play as many rounds as you want, and the last number you draw is the number of dollars you win, but each round costs an extra $1.

Then my expected payoff at the Nth round is (Expected number I draw - N) = 50.5 - N. So if I draw a number d at the (N-1)th round, my current payoff would be d - (N-1), so I should redraw if d - (N-1) < 50.5 - N, i.e., if d < 49.5. So my expected payoff at the (N-1)th round is 49(50.5-N) + 1/100*[(50 - (N-1)) + (51 - (N-1)) + ... + (100 - (N-1))] = 62.995 - N (if I did my calculations correctly), and so on.\n\nThe problem is that this gets messy, so I think I'm doing something wrong.

You get a number out of the hat, and either stop or go on. And you do it in some \"optimal\" way (maximizes expectation). If you do go on, the rule that will ensure you the maximal expectation is the same rule you used before - your original optimal rule.\n\nThis shows that your stopping rule can be characterized by some threshold $X$, which is the minimal number for which you'd stop (alternatively we could have chosen $X-1$, which is the maximal number for which you'd go on). Denote the expected gain by $E$. We have $$ E = -1 + \\frac{X-1}{100}E + \\frac{\\sum_{t=X}^{100} t}{100} = -1 + \\frac{X-1}{100} + \\frac{(100-X+1)(100+X)}{200}. $$ Multiplying by $200$ and rearranging, we get $$ 2(101-X)E = (101-X)(100+X) - 200. $$ Therefore $$ E = \\frac{(101-X)(100+X) - 200}{2(101-X)}. $$ This is maximized by $101 - 10\\sqrt{2} \\approx 86.86$. Thus the best value for $X$ is either $86$ or $87$. These values give $E \\approx 86.33$ and $E \\approx 86.37$, so $X = 87$ is better, and the value of the game is $1209/14$.\n\nMy calculations don't agree with Ross's, so there's probably a mistake somewhere; this doesn't invalidate the method.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nOur philosophies are the same. I think the difference is the factor $\\frac{100\u2212\u230aR\u230b}{100}$ in my first term, which is the chance that the next draw will be accepted. I think that should multiply your third term, which is the $\\frac{100+\u230aR\u230b}{2}$ part. I just edited my subtraction of the cost of another play, which decreased the expected value by 1. It appears it \"wants\" the expected value to be just below a natural. \u2013\u00a0 Ross Millikan Mar 17 '11 at 6:12\nadd comment\n\nYour expected return if you draw a number on the last round is 49.5 (because it costs a dollar to make the draw). On round N-1, you should keep what you have if it is greater than 49.5, or take your chances if it is less. The expected value if N=2 is then $\\frac {51}{100}\\frac {100+50}{2} -1 + \\frac {49}{100}49.5=61.505$ where the first term is the chance that you keep the first draw times the expectation of that draw (assuming you will keep it), the second is the cost of the first draw, and the third is the chance that you will decline the first draw and take your chances on the second times the expectation of the second draw.\n\nAdded: As Yuval makes more explicit, your strategy will be to quit when you get a number at least $X$. The gain then is $\\frac{100+X}{2}-\\frac{100}{101-X}$ where the first is the payoff and the second is the cost of the expected number of plays. As he says, this is maximized at X=87 with value $\\frac{1209}{14}=86.3571$.

Here $P$ is the transition matrix of the Markov chain.

The optimal strategy is to stop when the chain hits the set $\\lbrace x: f(x)=v(x)\\rbrace$. Here $v(x)$ means the value of state $x$, i.e., $v(x)$ is the maximum expected payout starting in state $x$ and using any finite stopping time $T$ as a strategy:\n\n$$v(x)=\\sup_T\\ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ f(X_T)\\, | \\, X_0=x\\right].$$\n\nThis is all nicely explained in the section on Optimal Stopping in Gregory Lawler's book \"Introduction to Stochastic Processes\".\n\nIn your problem we have $f(x)=x$ for $1\\leq x\\leq 100$, and $g(x)\\equiv 1$. Your Markov chain $(X_n)$ is a sequence of independent, uniform $\\lbrace 1,2,\\dots, 100\\rbrace $ random variables. Thus the $P$ operator applied to $h$ gives the constant function whose value is the average value of $h$, that is, $Ph(x)\\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{100} h(i)/100$. So we calculate $$u_0(x)=x,\\quad u_1(x)=\\max\\left(x,{99\\over 2}\\right), \\quad u_2(x)=\\max\\left(x,{12301\\over 200}\\right). $$\n\nTaking very large $N$ gives $$v(x)\\approx \\max\\left(x,{86.35714}\\right),$$ which shows that the optimal strategy (over all finite stopping times!) is to quit as soon as we get $87$ or higher, and the value of the game is $86.35714$ dollars.\n\nIn your problem it is pretty straightforward to calculate the exact answer, but this algorithm also gives the answer for more complicated games where exact calculations are not so easy.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

This is an interesting question which would be approached in different ways depending on the context in which it arrives (e.g., level of a course). For example, the curves could be assumed to be smooth or merely rectifiable. They could be assumed to be graphs, or not. The attainment of minimal length could be taken for granted, or require a proof. All this makes it hard to pitch the answer at the right level, and I'm most likely going to fail at that. Indeed, I do not see how one would get a solution in the form of a series, because in general the minimizer is not analytic. If this problem comes from a textbook, it would be helpful to have a reference so that an answer can be given within the context of that book.\n\nIf the existence and differentiability of a minimizing curve can be granted, then there is a variational argument to show it must have the same curvature at all points where it does not meet the constraint (i.e, does not lie on the vertical or horizontal axis). Indeed, write the curve in vector form $\\gamma(t)$, parametrized by arclength, and consider the perturbation $$\\Gamma(t)=\\gamma(t)+\\epsilon \\eta(t) R\\gamma'(t)$$ where $\\epsilon$ is a parameter, $\\eta$ is a smooth function with compact support, and $R$ denotes rotation by $\\pi/2$ clockwise. Note that $(Ru)\\times v =u\\cdot v$ and $u\\times Rv=-u\\cdot v$. The area bounded by $\\Gamma$ is expressed as an integral of $\\Gamma\\times \\Gamma'$, in which the linear term in $\\epsilon $ simplifies to $$2\\epsilon \\eta \\gamma'\\cdot \\gamma' - \\epsilon (\\eta \\gamma\\cdot \\gamma')' $$ Here the first term yields $2\\epsilon \\int \\eta$ and the second integrates to zero. Thus, we should have $\\int \\eta=0$ to preserve the area up to $O(\\epsilon^2)$.\n\nThe length of $\\Gamma$ is given by the integral of $|\\Gamma'(t)| = (\\Gamma'(t)\\cdot \\Gamma'(t))^{1/2}$ in which the linear term simplifies to\n$$ \\epsilon \\eta (\\gamma' \\cdot R\\gamma'') = \\epsilon \\eta \\kappa $$ where $\\kappa$ is the curvature of $\\gamma$. The conclusion is that $\\int \\eta \\kappa =0$ for any $\\eta$ such that $\\int \\eta =0$. Equivalently, $\\kappa$ is constant.\n\nThus, the minimizing curve will be a circular arc as long as it is free to move; i.e., as long as it does not hit the obstacle (vertical or horizontal axes). And the obstacle does get involved when $A$ is so small that no circular arc through $(0,a)$ and $(1,0)$ can bound area $A$ and stay within the first quadrant. When the obstacle takes effect, the minimizing curve consists of parts of the vertical and/or horizontal axes joined by a circular arc that is tangent to them. An obstacle must always be met tangentially: otherwise the point of contact could slide along the obstacle, decreasing length. This takes a separate perturbation argument, into which I will not go.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

Boyanov) Newsgroups: sci.math Subject: Volume of a tetrahedron Date: 27 Mar 1995 00:30:42 GMT Hi, I have a stupid question that I cannot solve myself and cannot find the answer to in any of the math handbooks I've looked at. Is there a general formula for the volume of an ARBITRARY polyhedron? I know everything there is to know about the polyhedron - the coordinates of the vertices, the equations of the planes that form the walls, the number of walls, the number of sides, the number of vertices, etc. About the only restriction that is put on the polyherdon is that it is \"convex\", i.e. all vertices lie in a single \"half-space\" relative to any wall. I was trying to do it by breaking up the polyhedron into a collection of tetrahedra and summing up the volumes of the tetrahedra, but I can't seem to come up with an algorithm that allows me to determine which vertices form the tetrahedra that make up the polyhedron. Any ideas? Is there a better nad easier way to do this? Please Cc: me if you post a followup, if at all possible. Thanks! Boyan -- Boyan I. Boyanov ============================================================================== From: (Dave Rusin) Newsgroups: sci.math Subject: Re: Volume of a tetrahedron Date: 27 Mar 1995 22:52:56 GMT In article <3l50vi$>, Boyan I. Boyanov wrote: >Is there a general formula for the volume of an ARBITRARY polyhedron? Well, I suppose I ought to answer this since I just advertised Green's theorem for a similar purpose. In this question, the author wants a space integral integral_P 1 dxdydz where P is the polyhedron. The corresponding technique is to use Stokes' Theorem, whose general form _ _ _/ w = _/ dw boundary(S) S (for w any differential form on S) specializes for 2-forms to _ _ _/ P dxdy + Q dydz + R dzdx = _/ (dP/dz + dQ/dx + dR/dy) dxdydz so we can get the space integral of 1, for example, by integrating the 2-form z dxdy over the surface of the polyhedron. We can compute the surface integrals face-by-face. The quick answer here is that the individual surface integrals, when divided by the area of the face, would compute the average value of the z coordinate on the face. Therefore, we can compute the surface integrals easily by averaging the z coordinates of the vertices of the face, and multiplying by an area: the surface integral int( zdxdy ) over a face spanned by (x0 y0 z0), (x1 y1 z1), and (x2 y2 z2) is (z0+z1+z2)/3 . | (1/2)( y1.(x0-x2) + y2.(x1-x0) + y0.(x2-x1) ) | This surface integral is added to the total if the three points are in counterclockwise order as seen from the outside of the polyhedron, subtracted otherwise. A proof is appended as a postscript to this post; it may perhaps reinforce an understanding of surface integrals. It perhaps bears mentioning that this procedure does not assume the polyhedron is convex, nor indeed homeomorphic to a sphere. It does assume that the polyhedron is closed (no boundary) and a triangularization of a manifold (which will then be compact and orientable, conditions which I would otherwise have to add). It is not necessary that all the faces be triangles, really, although any other polygons may be so divided. The method may also be extended to other surface integrals besides volume, and so for example may be used to compute the center of mass. One can remove the absolute values and simply add in the polynomial expression if an orientation is chosen consistent with the \"right-hand-rule\" for outward pointing normals. As in the previous post I will concede that there is some redundant calculation here, so that if it is important that the computation be done quickly it pays to watch for repeated line integrals and so on. dave __Derivation of formula for surface integral over one face__ Assuming that the face is not vertical, we can write z = Ax+By+C for some constants A, B and C (easily computed from any three non-collinear vertices on the face). Then that face contributes to the surface integral the sum A integral(x) + B integral(y) + C integral(1) where the integral may be taken over the projection of the face to the xy-plane (translation: ignore the z coordinates on the face). There is an orientation problem: the integral over the projection to the xy-plane will be off by a sign if the polyhedron faces \"in\" rather than \"out\", so you will need to know whether the interior of the polyhedron contains those points whose z coordinates are just larger than Ax+By+C or just smaller. In a previous post, I discussed integrating these very three surface integrals around a polygon. (These were done with Green's theorem.) The upshot is that these integrals may be computed as simple sums around the perimeter of the polygon. The segment from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1) contributes (x0 + x1)/2 . (y1-y0) to the integral of 1 over the polygon, (x0^2 + x0 x1 + x1^2)/6 . (y1-y0) to the integral of x, and ( (y0 x1 + x0 y1) + 2(x1 y1 + x0 y0) )/6 . (y1 - y0) to the integral of y. So, for example, if one face of your polyhedron is a triangle with vertices (x0,y0,z0), (x1,y1,z1), and (x2,y2,z2), then the equation for the plane is z = Ax + By + C where A, B, and C are determined by ( A ) ( x0 y0 1 )^{-1} ( z0 ) ( B ) = ( x1 y1 1 ) ( z1 ) ( C ) ( x2 y2 1 ) ( z2 ) We compute the line integrals around the triangle in the xy-plane: the integral of 1 is I1 = (1/2)( y1.(x0-x2) + y2.(x1-x0) + y0.(x2-x1) ) as in a followup I made to the previous post; the integral of x is this times (x0+x1+x2)/3, and the integral of y is the same factor I1 times (y0+y1+y2)/3. (All these should have their sign adjusted in case the points (x0,y0), (x1,y1), (x2,y2) do not wrap counterclockwise around the triangle. The correction is easy: since integral(1)=Area > 0, the sign correction to multiply by is just the sign S1 of I1. Thus, the surface integral over this face is the linear combination [ A(x0+x1+x2)/3 + B(y0+y1+y2)/3 + C ] . (S1 I1) As it happens, I1 is precisely the determinant of the matrix to be inverted above, so multiplyng thru we see that A B and C may be replaced by the cofactors, making division unnecessary. Apart from the sign correction, the previous surface integral may thus be written (z0.(y1-y2)+z1.(y2-y0)+z2.(y0-y1)) . (x0+x1+x2)/3 + (z0.(x2-x1)+z1.(x0-x2)+z2.(x1-x0)) . (y0+y1+y2)/3 + (z0.(x1y2-x2y1)+z1.(x2y0-x0y2)+z2.(x0y1-x1y0)) This, in turn, simplifies to just (z0+z1+z2)/3 . (I1) (again, times the sign correction so that S1 I1 > 0 ) This is the formula given above."}

Typical distances are less than a kiloparsec (3000 light-years, see for example post by @RobJeffries). Red-Giants (RG) still have a lifetime of about 10 Million years*, so only something like $10^{-4}$ would have already \"died\"... which means even if every single naked-eye star were a RG, only about 1 of those 10,000 would likely have already died. So the answer is probably 0-1 stars.\n\nSince the list of naked-eye (ish) stars is compiled, it wouldn't be too hard to just go through and see which (if any) have a non-negligible probability of having died... would be a good class project for someone! This, of course, completely neglects binarity... which is hard to model, even in detail. Naively, I think binaries are more likely to extend lifetimes than shorten them, however - so that probably makes this estimate even more optimistic.\n\nIn regards to the change from using Binoculars instead: again this could be explored using the above-linked catalog but I suspect @DavidHammen is right (in the comments above) - that the bulk of stars that become visible with Binoculars are low-mass dwarfs, decreasing the fraction of likely-to-have-died-visible-stars, and negligibly increasing the total expected number of dead stars.\n\n*Regarding RG lifetime, I'm not finding any great sources for lifetimes, but 10 Myr is the number of remember offhand. It looks like that might be on the lower end---again making this estimate more optimistic.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I think 1 Myr is more realistic for red giant evolution. Main sequence lifetimes for the most massive visible stars eg. Gamma Vel, are already less than 10 Myr. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0ProfRob Dec 8 '16 at 0:05\n\nYour Answer"}
{"problem": "What is the total number of seating arrangements for 4 married couples and 2 single men at a circular table, where each man can only sit next to his wife or another man?", "final_answer": "648", "raw_text": "Retrieved from https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1664140/4-married-couples-and-2-single-men-will-sit-at-a-circular-table\nText:\n$4$ married couples and $2$ single men sit at a circular table. In how many ways can they sit so that a man can't sit next to a woman who is not his wife?\n\nI have tried but I am not sure to the following answer :\n\nFirst, the husbands sit in the circular table of which the possible ways is $3!$.\n\nThe wives should sit next to her husband which is only $1$ way.\n\nThe two men can only be put between two husbands in only $2$ ways and they then can be permuted in $2$ ways. So the number of ways is $4$.\n\nBy applying the multiplication principle, the total number of ways for this possibility is $3! \\times 4$ = $24$.\n\nThe second possibility is similar which is making the wives sit first and put each husband next to his own wife and then put the single men. The total number of ways is also $24$.\n\nSo the answer is $24 + 24 = 48$.\n\n\nAs each woman has two neighbors, one way to have a woman not sit next to a man who is not her husband is to line up husband$_1$ wife$_1$ wife$_2$ husband$_2$ twice. Then we have three ways to pair up the couples and two ways to flip each pair left/right. We might as well put the leftmost of the pair including husband A at seat $1$ to break the rotational symmetry. Then there are three groups of seats for the other married couple and a factor two for placing the single men. Total is $$3 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2=72$$\nThe other way to deal with the women is to place all four together in some order, $4!$ ways and seat the husbands of the end ones next to them. Again break the symmetry by seating the leftmost woman in seat $1$. Now you can arrange the other four men any way you want, another $4!$ ways, giving $$4!^2=576$$ The total is then $$72+576=648$$\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Do you think OP wants to consider rotational overcounts? $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0K.

In the first case two men must sit next to their respecive wives in positions 5 and 10, while the other four men sit in any fashion that choose in positions 6-7-8-9. Thus 24\u00d724 = 576 permutations. For the second arrangement of the women, all four husbands must sit next to their wives leaving only the two single men with any free choice. Thus 24\u00d72 = 48 permutations.\n\nThe third female arrangement is tricky, in fact I had to edit my answer because I got it wrong the first time. If we count 24 permjtations for the women and two for the single men we seem to get 48. But because the women (and their husbands) are in a twofold rotationally symmetric arrangemet only half of these 48 are actually distinct. So we can really count only 24 additional permutations to go with the 576+48 from the other cases. Total: 648.\n\n\nYour Answer"}

Unfortunately, they started this semester in a bit of a slump, winning only 40 of their first 90 games in various inter-school competitions. That gave them a winning percentage of only about 44%.\n\nThen they found a new coach, who inspired them and significantly improved their overall level of play. This month they went on a hot streak, winning 3 out of every 5 games they played.\n\nWe used a scenario to loosen our thinking up and try to focus on three big preparation themes: prerequisite knowledge, big math ideas, and multiple approaches.\n\nLooking at the scenario, the Noyce Scholars noticed and wondered about cool math like:\n\n  \u2022 Quantities are represented as percentages, fractions, and ratios in this problem.\n  \u2022 How could you determine which coach was better?

Then I tried 60/100 + 40/90 and 100/190 and got 52.6% so I went down a bit and did 94/180 and got 52.22222% so I went down more and did 91/175 and 52% evenly. so they had played 90 games and now they played a total of 175, so they played 85 games that month\n\nCheck- 40/90 + 51/90 is 91/175 which is 52%\n\nHere are some of the initial things we noticed and wondered about M\u2019s work:\n\n  \u2022 She checks her work at the bottom\n  \u2022 In the check, she adds 40/90 + 51/90 = 91/175 and we wondered how she was using that calculation to check her work\n  \u2022 We also wondered in the check if she meant 51/85 instead of 51/90 because 51/85 was used earlier in the problem and would represent winning 3 out of every 5 games (17 sets of 5 games)\n  \u2022 We wondered how she thought of her first guess, 30/50\n  \u2022 We noticed that sometimes she used \u201cand\u201d and sometimes she used the \u201c+\u201d sign\n  \u2022 We noticed she used fraction notation and wondered if she was using it informally, using \u201c+\u201d to mean \u201cand\u201d and using \u201c/\u201d to mean \u201cout of\u201d\n  \u2022 We noticed that she got the correct answer, and it didn\u2019t take her very many guesses at all!\n\nAnd finally, we thought of some questions we could ask M. to help her revise her work and keep reflecting on the problem such as:\n\n  \u2022 This time, it took you 5 guesses to get the answer. What are some ways you could find an answer with fewer guesses next time you solve a similar problem?\n  \u2022 How did you decide what guess to start at?

Let the feedback vertex number $FVS(G)$ be the minimum number of vertices that have to be deleted from $G$ to break all cycles, so the minimum number of deletions needed to turn $G$ into a forest. Let the max leaf number $MaxLeaf(G)$ be the maximum number of leaves in any spanning tree for $G$.\n\nMy conjecture is that $FVS(G) \\leq MaxLeaf(G)$.\n\nThe two numbers come close for complete graphs: a $K_t$ has a spanning tree with $(t-1)$ leaves, and $(t-2)$ deletions are needed to turn $K_t$ into a forest. Since a forest can have an arbitrary number of leaves and has FVS number 0, the MaxLeaf number cannot be bounded by a function of the FVS number.\n\nI can prove that $FVS(G) \\leq 6 \\cdot MaxLeaf(G)$ through a lemma on spanning trees which says that for every connected graph G containing m vertices of degree $\\neq 2$, there is a spanning tree for G with at least $m/6$ leaves. Since the deletion of the set of vertices of degree $\\neq 2$ turns a graph into a forest if the graph is not a simple cycle, this shows that $FVS(G) \\leq 6 \\cdot MaxLeaf(G)$ when $G$ is not a simple cycle; and it is easy to see that the claim also holds when $G$ is a simple cycle since $MaxLeaf(C_n) = 2$ and $FVS(C_n) = 1$ for $n \\geq 3$.\n\nSince the complement of the leaves in a spanning tree form a connected dominating set, and since the complement of a feedback vertex set is a maximum induced forest, an alternative way to state the conjecture is: For any connected graph $G$ the number of vertices in the largest induced subforest of $G$ is at least as large as the minimum size of a connected dominating set in $G$.\n\nSo my question is: is this conjecture true, and does anyone know of any research related to it?\n\nshare|improve this question\nYou might consider looking at this circle of ideas for planar graphs.

I think it should be possible to prove that FVS(G) < 2 MaxLeaf(G).\n\nMore specifically, if NonTwo(T) is the number of nodes in spanning tree T that do not have degree two, and MaxNonTwo(G) is the maximum value of NonTwo(T) over all spanning trees of G, then I think that\n\n  \u2022 MaxNonTwo(G) < 2 MaxLeaf(G). This is obvious: in any tree, the number of leaves in T is greater than half of NonTwo(T), so the tree T that maximizes NonTwo(T) has greater than NonTwo(T)/2 leaves, and the max leaf spanning tree can only have even more leaves.\n\n  \u2022 FVS(G) \u2264 MaxNonTwo(G). More specifically, in every tree T maximizing NonTwo(T), the set of vertices of degree \u2260 2 form a feedback vertex set. For, if there's a cycle induced by the degree-2 vertices of T, then some edge e of the cycle does not belong to T. If the path in T connecting the endpoints of e passes through a vertex v that does not have degree three, then adding e and removing an edge incident to v produces a tree with a larger value of NonTwo(T). If this situation does not occur, then all edges in the induced cycle are non-tree edges; adding two consecutive edges from the cycle to T and removing two of the edges from T (two of the three edges at the median in T of the endpoints of the added cycle edges) produces a new tree with greater NonTwo again (the three endpoints of the added edges get their degree increased above two, the median goes from degree three to degree one, and two other vertices get their degrees decreased from three to two).\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer"}

In general, $g(X)$ is a nonlinear function. On the other hand, if the estimator is restricted to being of the form $\\hat{Y} = aX + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, then the linear MMSE estimator of $Y$ given $X$ is $\\hat{Y} = \\rho X$, that is, $$a = \\rho, ~ b = 0, ~\\text{minimizes}~E[(Y-aX-b)^2].$$ The linear MMSE estimator $\\rho X$ has a mean-square-error $E[(Y-\\rho X)^2] = 1 - \\rho^2$ and so the mean-square-error of the MMSE estimator $g(X)$ can be no larger:\n$$E[(Y-g(X))^2] \\leq 1 - \\rho^2.$$\n\nA simplified version of the question in the previous discussion is: if $g(\\cdot)$ is a decreasing function of its argument, show that $\\rho$ is nonpositive.\n\nMy question is: what is the linear MMSE estimate of $g(X) = E[Y \\mid X]$ given $X$? That is, what choice of real numbers $c$ and $d$ minimizes $E[(g(X) - cX - d)^2]$? Since $g(X)$ and $X$ both have zero mean and $X$ has unit variance, standard linear MMSE estimator theory gives that $d = 0$ and $$c = \\frac{\\text{cov}(g(X),X)}{\\text{var}(X)} = \\text{cov}(g(X),X) = E[Xg(X)]$$ which I think might work out to be $\\rho$, but I am not sure about this.

However, there could be many shortest paths from vertex s to a vertex v. So, I will pick the shortest path that has the most number of vertices in M.\n Merge all these paths together to get tree T.  \nThis seems to solve the problem in polynomial time. However, my concern is the number of shortest path from vertex s to a vertex v could be very large that can make this algorithm be exponential. I don't know if there is any upper bound for the number of shortest path between 2 vertex in a graph.  \nAlso, does any one know if this problem is NP problem or it could be solved in polynomial time?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nup vote 4 down vote accepted\n\nThe problem is NP-complete.\n\nI think that the following algorithm describes a polynomial reduction of SAT to your problem.\n\nLet S be an instance of SAT. So you have a finite set of clauses $C_1$, $C_2$, ...,$C_n$.\nand a finite set of variables $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_k$. Each clause contains some literals, i.e., variables $p_i$ and/or negated variable $\\lnot p_i$. (in 3sat we assume that each clause contains at most 3 literals.) We may assume that for each variable $p$ there is a clause $C_p$ containing only $p$ and $\\lnot p$, so $n\\ge k$.\n\nMake S into a graph as follows: There is a special vertex $ s$. For each variable $p$ there are two vertices $p$ and $\\lnot p$, both connected to $s$ (EDITED to simplify) by an edge. There is a vertex for every clause. Each literal $L$ is connected by an edge to each clause $C$ in which $L$ appears.\n\nThe set $M$ will be the set of all clauses.\n\nIf the original problem S was satisfiable, say with an assignment $A$, then then there is an optimal tree with $n+k$ edges: Connect $s$ with all literals which are true under $A$, and connect each clause $C$ with a literal $L$ in $C$ that is true under $A$.\n\n(EDITED to clarify and to close a gap:) Conversely, if there is an optimal graph with at most $n +k$ edges, then:\n\n  1. Each clause has to be on the tree, so it has to be connected to some literal. This costs $n$ edges.\n\n  2. For each variable $p$, either $p$ or $\\lnot p$ has to be on the tree (because of $C_p$), so either $p$ or $\\lnot p$ has to be connected (by an edge) to $s$ (because the distance has to be $1$). These connections cost $k$ edges.\n\n  3. So from each such pair EXACTLY one is connected with $s$. Those literals which are connected to $s$ now define a satisfying truth assignment.\n\nHence the instance $G,M$ of your problem that I constructed from the SAT problem $S$ has a solution of size at most $n+k$ iff $S$ is satisfiable. So any algorithm to solve your problem also solves SAT. Hence your problem is NP-complete.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks a lot goldstern. I thinks this transformation is correct. I just wonder why we don't connect s directly to each variable instead of going through path o length n. That way we can have a tree of n + k edges, can't we? \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 1:18\nanother problem with this transformation is that you're trying to limit the number of edges while the optimal tree must have minimum number of vertices. With the way you select the tree, the number of vertices is not minimum. \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 5:02\nYou are right, the paths are not necessary. I edited my answer to simplify it (and also to clarify some points). \u2013\u00a0 Goldstern May 8 '11 at 8:19\nI do not understand your question about edges vs vertices. A tree with v vertices has v-1 edges. So you minimize the number of edges iff you minimize the number of vertices. \u2013\u00a0 Goldstern May 8 '11 at 8:20\nMaybe I didn't quite understand your proof. So let me give an example. Let say I have a 3SAT (x+y+z)(x+\u00acy+z). We can assign x=y=z=T. So, if we follow the proof, then we will get a tree with 6 vertices and n+k=2+3=5 edges. However, I can have another smaller tree that can have the same shortest paths to vertices in M={C1, C2}. That tree has 3 edges connecting the vertex representing x with s, C1, and C2. It also has only 4 vertices. Am I missing something here? \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 8:48\n\nJust a rough idea: (I am not really an expert on graph theory, so there may be a much better upper bound.)\n\nYou can group the vertices according to their distance to $s$, say\n\n$L_i=\\{v\\in V|dist(s,v)=i\\}$\n\nThen of course the $L_i$ are pairwise disjoint. Any shortest path from $s$ to a given vertex $v$ has to pass the $L_i$ ascending (you can easily proof this fact), so first a vertex from $L_1$, then one from $L_2$, and so on. That means there are at most $\\prod_{i=1}^{dist(s,v)-1}|L_i|$ shortest paths. As $|L_i|\\leq |V|$, you have a polynomial upper bound.\n\nWhile thinking about it: There might be a way to press this bound much lower, as $|L_i|=|V|$ only happens when all vertices have distance 1, which means the shortest path is the direct connection between $s$ and $v$. For decreasing amount of vertices in the $L_i$, the possible length of the path grows. You probably could use this to get a better bound.\n\nI do not see why the rest of your algorithm should not work.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThank you. I didn't have time to verify your proof here but I think the above transformation is correct. \u2013\u00a0 chepukha May 8 '11 at 1:19\n\nYour Answer"}

It is somewhat complicated to work with $X$ directly, so we think of $X$ as a sum of simpler variables:\n\nFor $i=1,2,\\ldots10$, let $X_i=\\cases{1 & \\text{if the }i\\text{th pair is matched},\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}.}$\n\nThen each $X_i$ is a Bernoulli variable and $X=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}X_i$.\n\nExpectation is linear, so $$ \\Bbb E(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\,\\Bbb E(X_i). $$\n\nNow we fix $i$ and find $\\Bbb E(X_i) $:\n\nSince $X_i$ is a Bernoulli variable, $\\Bbb E(X_i)=P[X_i=1]$. But the probability that $X_i=1$ is the probability that the $i$th pair was matched. Since it is equally likely that any one of the other 19 shoes is paired with the left shoe of the $i$th pair, $P[X_i=1]={1\\over19}$.\n\nSo $\\Bbb E(X_i)={1\\over19}$.\n\nFinally, we have:\n\n$$\\Bbb E(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\Bbb E(X_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}{1\\over19}=10/19.$$\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI should mention why $P[X_i=1]={1\\over19}$ without \"hand waving\": there are ${20!\\over2^{10}}\\cdot{1\\over10!}$ ways to divide the 20 shoes into pairs and there are ${18!\\over2^9}\\cdot{1\\over9!}$ ways to divide them into pairs with the $i$th pair matched. $P[X_i=1]$ is the ratio of these quantities, which is $1/19$. \u2013\u00a0 David Mitra Nov 14 '11 at 10:15\nInteresting that you're allowed to pair a right shoe with another right shoe.

For example, if I have a probablity of 0.34 of \nwinning a game, I could use Bernoulli trials to tell me my probability \nof winning three out of five.\n\n\"What does this have to do with insurance?\" you may ask. Well, if my \ngame is picking a house, and I win that game if the house is insured, \nwe can use Bernoulli trials to find the probability of \"winning\" 0, 1, \n2, 3, or 4 times. This is also the probability that 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 \nof the houses are insured.\nOne thing that has to be true about our game before we can use \nBernoulli trials is that each play must be independent. This means \nthat one house having insurance has nothing to do with its neighbor \nalso having insurance.\n\nI'm sure there's a chapter about Bernoulli trials in your textbook if \nyou want more information. \n\nLet's say I have n trials (or n plays of a game), with a probability p \nfor success. Then the probability that I will win EXACTLY k of these \nn trials is given by\n\n  P(X = k) = (n choose k) * (p^k) * (1 - p)^(n-k)\n\nSo for our problem, if n = 4, and k = 3, and p = .6 we have\n\n  P(X = 3) = (4 choose 3) * (.6^3) * (.4)^1\n           = (4) * (.6^3) * .4\n           = (4) * (.216) * .4\n           = .3456\n\nHowever, this isn't all.  Your problem asked for the probability of \n\"at least 3\" being insured. So if 4 of the 4 get insurance, then the \nproblem is also solved. \n\nI'll let you use the Bernoulli trials for P(X=4). (Remember that k=4.)\n\nThus the probability that at least 3 of the four houses are insured \n\n  P(X=4) + P(X=3) \n\nand you'll see that these are the answers you're looking for.\n\nGood luck, and don't hesitate to write back with more questions.\n\n-Doctor Sonya,  The Math Forum\nAssociated Topics:\nHigh School Probability\n\nSearch the Dr. Math Library:\n\nFind items containing (put spaces between keywords):\nClick only once for faster results:\n\n\nparts of words whole words\n\nSubmit your own question to Dr. Math\n\n[Privacy Policy] [Terms of Use]\n\n\nAsk Dr. MathTM\n\u00a9 1994-2013 The Math Forum"}

If its first and second partial derivatives exist and continuous its differential is\n\n    dv=\u2202v/\u2202T dT + \u2202v/\u2202P dp.\n\n    an the mixed second partial derivatives are equal:\n\n\n    The integral of dv is independent of he path taken, v is a \"potential\", only if that condition holds.\n\n    In case of the first example, \u2202v/\u2202T=R/P and \u2202v/\u2202P=-RT/P2. The mixed derivatives are equal.\n\n    Now you have \u2202v/\u2202T=R/P, and integrate with respect to T: V=RT/P + integration constant. But that constant can depend on P, so v(T,P)=R/P+f(P). You can find f(P) from the condition that the derivative of v with respect to P has to be -RT/P2:\n    \u2202v/\u2202P= -RT/P2+df/dP=-R/P2, so f=constant.\n\n    Check if the other dv can be the perfect differential of a potential function."}

Sorry.\n\n    Something like that: In these \"simple\" problems, forces essentially come from gravity or contact. An external force will come from contact to the external world (or existance of gravity with an external object), and an external torque will have to be produced by that external force.\n\n    Is any part of the system (bullet + block) in contact to the external world (rope, Earth, etc.)? Does if feel a force from those parts? Does this force produce a torque about an axis through the peg? :)\n\n    Also, notice that the problem considers a \"long\" time interval before and after the collision.

Jan 30, 2013 #7\n\n\n    User Avatar\n\n    At first I had thought that the correct answer was D. Since as the block moves it feels a force due to the rope (which has a horizontal component after the rope tilts a little) there are external forces and no conservation of linear momentum. Tricky question since you are told to consider a fairly large time interval - momentum is still conserved during and short after the collision, but not a little later as the block moves.\n\n    Mechanical energy is lost in the collision due to deformation, as the bullet sticks inside the block.\n\n    The force due to the rope (the external force), also, always passes through the axis, so it does not produce an external torque and at first I thought angular momentum is conserved. However, taking gravity into account, gravity indeed produces an external torque and therefore no quantity is conserved, so I would say the correct answer is E.\n  9.

Anyhow: if we include gravity - then there is an external force messing with the system. Anything with momentum being conserved will get messed up. That leaves energy - but the collision is inelastic - and \"none of the above\".\n\n    I had misread the question - I thought it referred to the collision at t=0, which is where it usually appears.\n\n    To be super-rigorous, you'd have to construct the equations for each case.\n    However, most of the questions in this paper can be tackled by just going through each of the alternatives one at a time after stopping to think of the processes involved. There's usually two options that look likely, which is where you look harder.\n\nSimilar Discussions: F = MA 2009 # 14 (Momentum Quick Conceptual Question)\n  1. 2009 f=ma #24 (Replies: 1)"}

You have to consider the value ranges of x.\n\n    Perhaps a good place to start is to consider the value of each expression as they pass the \"difficult\" value of x in each case, and how those behave as x is large-negative and large-positive in each case again.\n\n    There are three relevant ranges of x, one of which is a little trickier than the other two.\n  4.

Jan 14, 2013 #5\n    You mean x < -3 is not in the 'solution set' right? x is -4 makes it not a true statement.\n\n    After trying the first method again (the textbook's method except they didn't show any examples with two fractions both with x in the denominator) I found that x > -3 , x cannot equal -1/2 , 0\n  7. Jan 14, 2013 #6\n    x can equal anything. Of the two expressions being considered in the question, each one is undefined at one value of x (which you already have indicated you know).\n\n    {x<-3} is a range of values where both expressions are well-defined. You might like to explore this range with some values of x (like -4, -5, -10) to see how the functions are behaving.\n  8. Jan 14, 2013 #7\n    When you input -4 for x, you get 6 < 0.75 which means that x < -3 is not a part of the solution right?\n\n    When you input -1/2 for x, you get -1 < -1 which again is not true.\n\n    Although plugging values is good to check answers, I wanted to know if my method was correct. I don't have the answer to this question though.\n\n    What I did was solve for x under all circumstances. When x+3 > 0 and x > 0 and then when x+3 < 0 and x < 0 and then when x+3 > 0 but x < 0 then when x+3 < 0 and x > 0\n\n    The idea behind this is that when solving for x, multiplying by -(x+3) or -(x) would switch the inequality sign. So the possibility that one or the other or both are positive or negative becomes an issue. Is this a correct way to solve this inequality?\n  9.

So consider 3 cases:\n    1) x< -3. Then both x+ 3 and x are negative. Multiplying the above inequality by x(x+ 3) is multiplying by a positive number (the product of two negatives) so the direction of inequality does not change. [itex](x- 2)(x)< (x+ 3)(x+ 1)[/itex]. [itex]x^2- 2x< x^2+ 4x+ 3[/itex]. Subtract [itex]x^2[/itex] from both sides to get [itex]-2x< 4x+ 3[/itex] so that [itex]0< 6x+ 3= 3(x+ 1)[/itex]. Dividing both sides by the positive number 3, we have [itex]0< x+ 1[/itex] or [itex]x< -1[/itex] which can't happen when x< -3.\n\n    2) -3< x< 0. Now x+ 3 is positive but x is still negative. Multiplying both sides by x(x+ 3) is now multiplying by a negative number and changes the direction of the inequality: [itex](x- 2)(x)> (x+ 3)(x+ 1)[/itex]. The same calculations as before go through with the changed inequality sign: [itex]x< -2[/itex]. That tells us that the orignal inequality is true for [itex]-3< x< -2[/itex].\n\n    3) x> 0. Now both x+ 3 and x are positive so j=multiplying both sides of the inequality by x(x+ 3) does not change the sign: [itex](x- 2)(x)< (x+ 3)(x+ 1)[/itex] and again we get [itex]x> -1[/itex]. Of course that is true for all x> 0 so we have the inequality true for all x> 0.\n\n    We have, so far, that the inequality is true for -3< x< -2 and x> 0. You should also check to see if it is true at x= -3, x= -2, and x= 0.\n    Last edited: Jan 17, 2013\n  19.

Do you mean the probability of rolling a $1$ at least once, exactly once, or both times? \u2013\u00a0Isaac Solomon Jan 16 '13 at 5:38\nGetting two $1$'s in a row must be less probable than getting the first one. You have to start with the first one, then can fail on the second roll. B.D has the correct answer, but this might help with intuition. \u2013\u00a0Ross Millikan Jan 16 '13 at 5:45\n@RossMillikan makes an excellent point. If you are trying to sync this intuition up with the array visualization I posted below, the single $1$ probability corresponds to the top-left square among just the squares in the top row; the two consecutive $1$s probability corresponds to that same square among all $100$ squares. \u2013\u00a0Benjamin Dickman Jan 16 '13 at 6:03\nup vote 3 down vote accepted\n\nThink of a $10 \\times 10$ array of squares, where each square represents a possible roll. For example, we could say the square in row $a$ column $b$ corresponds to rolling an $a$ first, and then rolling a $b$.\n\nWith these $100$ different possibilities, only one of them - the one in the top left hand corner - corresponds to rolling two consecutive $1$s.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $1/100 = 1\\%$.\n\n(More generally, you want to be multiplying the probabilities of independent events rather than adding them.

Thank you very much. \u2013\u00a0hoipolloi Jan 16 '13 at 5:46\nYou could also visualize it by drawing a tree: 10 different points for each of the possible rolls, then each of those points gets 10 possible points for the subsequent roll. Again, you will end up with 100 possible two roll scenarios, of which only one is 1 followed by 1. This \"tree approach\" might make it clearer why you are multiplying probabilities instead of adding them. \u2013\u00a0Benjamin Dickman Jan 16 '13 at 5:48\n\nThe probability of rolling the same number twice on a $10$-sided die is $1\\over 10^2$, which is $1\\over 100$.

Show that its radius shrinks at a constant rate. If it melts to 8/27 of its original volume in 20 minutes, how long will it take to melt completely? Please I need your help.\n\n\nHi Jay.\n\nLet's take this question step by step: first, the \"snowball melts at a rate...\" is clearly referring to the change in volume of the snowball with respect to time. If V = volume,\nA = surface area and R = radius, then dV/dt is what this phrase means.\n\nNow \"...proportional to its surface area.\" means that the dV/dt (the first part of the sentence) varies directly with the surface area A. Varies directly just means that the two terms are equal, but there is a constant of proportionality (usually called k) as a factor (usually attached to the second term). That means:\n\ndV/dt = kA.\n\nSo that's all the first sentence says.\n\nThe question is \"show that the radius shrinks at a constant rate\". That means the change in radius with respect to time is constant (let's call this constant q). So that means you are asked to show dr/dt is some constant.\n\nThe way to do this is to know the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere:\n\nV = (4/3) \u03c0 r3 and A = 4 \u03c0 r2\n\nand take derivatives.\n\ndV/dt is the derivative of volume with respect to time, but remember that r is also changing, so you have to use the chain rule:\n\ndV/dt = d/dt((4/3) \u03c0 r3) = (4/3) \u03c0 3 r2 (dr/dt)\n\nNow let's plug that into the first equation:\n\n(4/3) \u03c0 3 r2 (dr/dt) = k A = k(4 \u03c0 r2) = 4 \u03c0 k r2\n\nSo when we simplify by dividing left and right sides by 4 \u03c0 r2, we get:\n\ndr/dt = k\n\nwhich is saying exactly what we wanted to prove: that dr/dt is constant.\n\nFor the second (numerical) part of the question, you don't know the\noriginal volume (call it V again), but hopefully it will cancel out\nlater, so just start with what you know. Call the original radius R,\nthe radius after 20 minutes r, and the volume after 20 minutes v,.\n\nV = 4/3 \u03c0 R3\nv = 4/3 \u03c0 r3\nv = (8/27)V\n\nNow use this last equation to tie together the two volume equations:\n\n4/3 \u03c0 r3 = (8/27) (4/3 \u03c0 R3)\n\nso when you simplify and take the cube root,\n\nr = 2/3 R\n\nThat's very useful, because it is saying that the new radius is 2/3 the initial radius. But since the change in radius with respect to time is constant, the radius is shrinking at a constant rate. So if the radius lost 1/3 its length in 20 minutes, it will take another 40 minutes to melt away completely.\n\nStephen La Rocque.>"}

You have 50 points. $S$ is the set of all $\\binom{50}{5}=2118760$ selections of 5 points. You want a subset $B \\subset S$ such that any $s \\in S$ intersects at least one $b \\in B$ in at least 2 points. That is an interesting problem and does not immediately strike me as familiar. Call a member of $B$ a block. A given block intersects $152026$ members of $S$ in 2 or more points. This gives a lower bound of $14$ for the possible size of $B$. Of course this a weak bound since two disjoint blocks determine $200$ members of $S$ intersecting one in 2 points and the other in 3 and another $4000$ intersecting each in 2 points. If my calculations are correct, that raises the lower bound to at least $19$ blocks. I doubt that $20$ would suffice.\n\nSo far my record is 44 blocks.\n\nLet me digress for some terminology (which I'll try to keep fairly standard). a design is a pair $D=(V,B)$ where $V$ is a set of $v$ vertices and a $B$ is a collection of subsets called blocks There are various names for designs which satisfy additional conditions. Two are\n\nEvery pair of points is in exactly one common block. (Then $D$ is called a linear space)\n\nEvery pair of points is in at least one common block and every block has the same number $k$ of points. (Then $D$ is called a $(v,k,2)$-covering design and the La Jolla Repository has information about these.)\n\nWhen both conditions hold, $D$ is called a Steiner System $S(2,k,v).$ Many that one encounters arise from algebraic constructions. This is perhaps due to the Streetlight effect.\n\nI'll coin the term super-linear space for a design such that every pair of points from $V$ occur in at least one common block but the blocks may have various sizes (since I don't know a standard name. It turns out that this might be called a lottery wheel although that term is not very specific)\n\nYou have $50$ points and do not require that every pair of points is in a block but do wish that from every 5 points (element of $S$), at least one pair is in at least one block. You also want all blocks to have $5$ points. I'll find it convenient to only require that each block have at most 5 points, then one can arbitrarily enlarge blocks to size 5.\n\nAll my constructions have this form: Split the points into 4 groups (or 2 or 3) and for each group take a super-linear space with no block having more than 6 points. Then any element of $S$ has two points in the same group and those two points are in a common block. Perhaps one can do better without this restriction. I include a few other possibilities in case it inspires anyone to get a better result.\n\n44* blocks. Split into 4 groups of size 21,21,4 and 4. For each of the large groups take the 21 lines of a projective plane of order 4 and let the two small groups be 4 point blocks. Now any set in $S$ has at least two points in a common group and those two pints determine a unique block.\n\n60 blocks: split the points into two sets of 25 and use the 30 lines of an affine plane of order 5 on each. This is overkill because any 3 element set has two points in some block. Perhaps there is a way to cull out some of the lines.\n\nUnder 52 blocks If the points are partitioned into 3 groups of 13 and one of 11 (with two fake points added in) then (for each group) the lines of a projective plane of order 3 were taken as blocks this would give a solution with 52 blocks of size 4. Delete $X,Y$ to improve this to 45 of size 4 and 6 of size 3 and one of size two. Now tack the block of size 2 onto a block of size 3 to get $51$ blocks (one of size 5). (If $X,Y$ are in different groups it might be better, I haven't checked.) One can also get rid of at least 3 more blocks as follows: take a block abcd, delete it and add b as a fifth point to a block containing c and another containing c, add c as a fifth point to two blocks containing d and a and add d as a fifth point to two blocks containing a and b.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nThanks a lot!

The construction is just like that of $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ so that the points are lines passing through the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ and the lines of $\\mathbb{P}^3$ correspond to (two-dimensional) planes passing through the origin. $\\mathbb{P}^3(F_4)$ has $(4^4-1)/(4-1)=85$ points, though. \u2013\u00a0Douglas Zare Jun 7 '11 at 17:53\n$\\mathbb{P}^3(F_3)$ has ${40 \\choose 2}/{4 \\choose 2} = 130$ lines, not $40$, so the construction for $42$ blocks actually uses $132$ blocks. It was a little too good to be true since it would mean any quadruple would intersect a block in $2$ points, and it would be easy to use the $5$th points to make a line redundant. \u2013\u00a0Douglas Zare Jun 7 '11 at 18:40\n\nHere is a construction of size $38$. Call the points cards and divide the deck into $4$ suits, so that $2$ suits have ranks $1,...,13$ and $2$ suits have ranks $1,...,12$. Every hand of $5$ cards must have at least $2$ cards in some suit. So, if we cover all possible pairs in each suit, the result will be a wheel.\n\nThe La Jolla Covering Repository says that $C(12,5,2)=9$ so we can cover all pairs within the short suits with $9$ hands each:\n\n1  2  4  7  9 \n1  3  4  6 12 \n1  3  7 10 11 \n1  5  6  8 12 \n2  3  5  7  8 \n2  6 10 11 12 \n3  6  7  9 12 \n4  5  8 10 11 \n5  8  9 10 11 \n\nSimilarly, it says $C(13,5,2) \\le 10$ so we can cover all pairs within the long suits with $10$ hands each:\n\n1  2  3  4  5\n1  6  7  8  9\n1 10 11 12 13\n2  3  6  7 10\n2  3  8  9 11\n4  5  6  7 11\n4  5  8  9 10\n2  3  4 12 13\n5  6  7 12 13\n1  8  9 12 13\n\nThe total is $38$ hands which intersect each hand of $5$ cards in at least $2$ cards. So, $L(50,5,5,2) \\le 38$.\n\nEdit: The best this method can do with the coverings known in the La Jolla Repository is $37$. That can be done by splitting a $50$ card deck into suits of sizes $(17, 11, 11, 11),$ $(13,13,13,11)$, or $(15, 13, 11, 11)$.\n\n$C(17,5,2) \\le 16$.\n\n$C(15,5,2) \\le 13$.\n\n$C(13,5,2) \\le 10$ as shown above.\n\n$C(11,5,2) \\le 7$.\n\nshare|cite|improve this answer\nThanks (truly!) for clarifying the question and making my LJCR comment less useful (since a covering design was not wanted) and also more useful (by showing how two covering designs could help).

If the reference time is when the vehicle is M metres\nfrom the origin, then p(t) = M-20t and p'(t) = -20 is constant.\nLet d(t) be the distance BX at time t seconds, and a(t) be the\nangle BXA at time t seconds.

Taking the logarithm to the base 10 of n!. If the log comes out to be x, it is not hard to see that the number of digits must be the lowest integer greater than or equal to x, i.e, $floor(x)+1$. Now the question comes down to approximating the $log(n!)$ It is possible to prove by induction that n! lies between $(\\frac{n}{2})^n$ and $(\\frac{n}{3})^n$. Thus the log(n!) lies between $nlog(\\frac{n}{2})$ and $nlog(\\frac{n}{3})$. We can get a pretty tight bound if we used log tables for log(20/3), but as you have disallowed that, using the upper limit(which becomes log(10) = 1) will do quite nicely too. The answer comes to 20*log(10) = 20, which should tell you that the expected number of digit is about 19 or 20.(Since 20 is only the upper bound).

Do you mean the set of all x satisfying C(x)? \u2013\u00a0 Sergei Ivanov Apr 22 '10 at 20:14\nSergei, even if he does mean all x, then my answer still gives a one-element set. \u2013\u00a0 Joel David Hamkins Apr 22 '10 at 20:29\nBut your answer isn't sporting! \u2013\u00a0 Simon Thomas Apr 22 '10 at 20:42\nBut it is optimal...But seriously, I am interested in the projective version. \u2013\u00a0 Joel David Hamkins Apr 22 '10 at 20:54\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nYou probably won't like this, but the answer is cardinality 1.\n\nLet C(x) be the statement, \"x=0 and the Axiom of Choice holds\".\n\nZF doesn't prove that any x satisifes C(x), since it doesn't prove AC. If AC fails, then no x can have C(x). Thus, ZF+\u00acAC proves that no x has C(x).\n\nBut ZFC proves that C(0) holds, and so it proves that Q={0} is the desired set.\n\n\nThe set { x | C(x) } is an indicator set for AC, in the sense that it is either 0 or 1, depending exactly on whether AC holds. A similar trick works to construct indicator sets for any assertion.\n\nI have suggested that the question be focused on the possibility of projective statements C(x). A projective statement is one expressible in the language of second order number theory, with quantifiers over real numbers and natural numbers. Thus, the question would be whether there is a specific projective statement C(x) such that ZFC proves that Q = { x | C(x) } is nonempty, but ZF does not.\n\nThis version of the question is exactly equivalent to the question of whether ZFC is not conservative over ZF for projective sentences, since if there is a counterexample C(X), then the assertion $\\exists x C(x)$ is provable in ZFC but not ZF, and if $\\sigma$ is provable in ZFC but not in ZF, then the set {x | $\\sigma$} is ZFC provably all of the reals, but ZF is consistent with this set being empty.\n\nTherefore, the question amounts to: Is ZFC not conservative over ZF for projective statements?\n\nI think it is not, but I don't have a counterexample.\n\nMeanwhile, I can say that if one replaces ZF here with ZF+DC, looking at the difference between the full Axiom of Choice and the Axiom of Dependent Choices, rather than at the difference between full AC and no AC at all, then the answer is that it IS conservative. In this MO answer, I explained that ZFC is conservative over ZF+DC for projective sentences, and so if one replaces ZF with ZF+DC in the question, the answer would be no. But without DC, weird things can happen in the reals, and I'm not yet quite sure about it.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIn this case, the formula asserting that there is such a nonempty Q is exactly equivalent to AC. You could replace AC in this argument with any statement whatsoever; what you get is a kind of indicator set for the truth of that statement. It is empty when the statement fails, and it is 1 when the statement holds. \u2013\u00a0 Joel David Hamkins Apr 22 '10 at 20:05\nI take this answer to show that you will want to revise your question. Probably it is natural to restrict the complexity of the statement C(x). For example, can there be a projective such C(x)? \u2013\u00a0 Joel David Hamkins Apr 22 '10 at 20:22\nThis is a really cool answer. \u2013\u00a0 Harry Gindi Apr 22 '10 at 20:27\nThanks, Harry. \u2013\u00a0 Joel David Hamkins Apr 22 '10 at 20:33\n@Joel: I'm thinking about C(x) = \"x is a minimal uncountable ordinal\".

Joel is right: L is not countable in that model of ZF. The basic idea goes back to Plotkin who showed that given any countably categorical theory T you can find a model of ZF with an model M of T such that the only subsets of M that exist are the T-definable subsets of M. This doesn't directly apply to the algebraic closure of Q since ACF_0 is not countably categorical, but Hodges showed that ACF_0 is still nice enough for the basic idea to work... \u2013\u00a0 Fran\u00e7ois G.

For every such $x$, one has $50\\%$ chances that the first step is to $x+1$ and $50\\%$ chances that the first step is to $x-1$, and from there, one looks for the probability $u(x\\pm1)$ to hit $x_1$ before $x_0$. Hence, $u(x)=\\frac12(u(x+1)+u(x-1))$.\n\nThis means that $x\\mapsto u(x)$ is a straight line on the integer interval $[x_0,x_1]$. Obviously, $u(x_0)=0$ and $u(x_1)=1$ hence $u(x)$ is as written above.\n\nA slightly more advanced method is to consider the position $X_n$ of the random walk at time $n\\wedge\\tau_0\\wedge\\tau_1$ where $\\tau_0$ is the first hitting time of $x_0$ and $\\tau_1$ is the first hitting time of $x_1$. This means that the random walk performs equiprobable independent $\\pm1$ steps and that one stops it as soon as it hits $x_0$ or $x_1$. Then $(X_n)$ is a bounded martingale hence its expectation does not depend on $n$. Now $X_0=x$, $X_n\\to x_1$ on $S=[\\tau_1<\\tau_0]$, $X_n\\to x_0$ on $[\\tau_0<\\tau_1]=S^c$, and one gets $$ x=X_0=\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}E(X_n)=E(\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}X_n)=x_0P(S^c)+x_1P(S). $$ Since $P(S)+P(S^c)=1$, this yields the result.\n\nIn the Brownian motion case, one can still use the idea of the second method, replacing finite differences by a differential operator: one gets that $u(x_0)=0$, $u(x_1)=1$ and $u''(x)=0$ for every real number $x$ in the interval $(x_0,x_1)$. This means that $u$ is affine in this case as well hence $u(x)$ is given by our first displayed formula, where now the argument $x$ is a real number.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer"}

One way to achieve this is to place a rook in position $(i,j,k)$ if and only if $i+j+k=0\\mod n$. In general, there are \"many\" ways to do this.\n\nEach such \"attack-free\" rook position can be colored with $c$ colors. When we fix an $i$, we can then count the colors in the matrix $(i,.,.)$, and can do similarly for each $j$ and $k$. Call this set of tuples of colors-counts the \"color profile\". For each color profile, there is either an even or odd number of colored rook positions that achieve it. I want to know the largest $c$ such that all color profiles have an even number of colored rook positions achieving it. In particular, I want to say that $c=\\omega(n)$.

I state it with $d\\ge3$ because I can solve the $d=2$ case exactly. In particular\n\nFor each $n$, for any $c\\le n-1$, and any color profile $P$ on grid $[n]^2$, $N(P)\\equiv 0 \\mod 2$. For $c\\ge n$, there are profiles $P$ where $N(P)\\equiv 1\\mod 2$.\n\nThis can be proven by exhibiting a bijection between colored rook sets (which in d=2 are just permutation matrices). Specifically, using the pigeonhole principle $c\\le n-1$ implies that there are two rooks with the same color. If they were at positions $(i,j)$ and $(i',j')$, then we replace them with the rooks of the same color at positions $(i,j')$ and $(i',j)$. (Of course, one needs to make this well-defined to ensure a bijection.)\n\nPossible Methods\n\nI see two possible methods of proof\n\n  \u2022 generalize the above bijection proof to the 3-dimensional case\n\n    \u2022 I don't know how to use the pigeonhole principle to get such an extension, but it seems possible that there is a method to show that some motif exists in any colored rook set, and then argue that we can alter this motif to get the bijection\n  \u2022 define a system of polynomials (over $\\mathbb{F}_2$) such that the solution set corresponds to exactly the colored rook sets inducing a color profile $P$.

For example:\n\n123       100 010 001\n231  <->  001 100 010\n312       010 001 100\n\nA colouring of the Latin square is a partition of its entries (corresponding to a coloured rook set).\n\nWe can therefore readily construct colour profiles P with c=n2 such that N(P)=1 (that is, by partitioning some Latin square into n2 parts). But we can do much better...\n\nA defining set is a partial Latin square with a unique completion. A critical set is a minimal defining set. Let scs(n) be the size of a smallest critical set for Latin squares of order n. From a Latin square L containing a critical set of size scs(n), we can choose a partition (i.e. a c-colouring) such that the entries in the critical set are in parts of size 1 and the remaining entries of L are in a single part. This also will give rise to a colour profile P in which N(P)=1. It has been shown that scs(n)\u2264n2/4 for all n. (see J. Cooper, D. Donovan and J. Seberry, Latin squares and critical sets of minimal size, Australasian J. Combin 4 (1991), 113\u2013120.) Hence we can deduce that for some c<=n2/4+1 we have N(P)\u22611 (mod 2). But with a more intelligent choice of the partition, we can do better...\n\nIn fact, we can use the constructions in Cooper et al. to construct a colour profile P with c=n for which N(P)=1. I will only be able to prove this by example here (but it should be clear it can be readily generalised): Partition the \"back circulant\" Latin square of order 6 as follows.\n\n123456     100000   020000   003000   000000   000000   000456\n234561     000000   200000   030000   000000   000000   004561\n345612 <-> 000000 + 000000 + 300000 + 000000 + 000000 + 045612\n456123     000000   000000   000000   000000   000000   456123\n561234     000000   000000   000000   000004   000000   561230\n612345     000000   000000   000000   000040   000005   612300\n\nNow observe that the three colour profiles are:\n\n100005  111003  111003\n020004  011004  011004\n003003  001005  001005\n000204  000006  000006\n000015  000105  000105\n000006  000114  000114\n\nTogether these form P. Given P, we can observe that any Latin square of order 6 with colour profile P must contain the following partial Latin square:\n\n\nWhich is a critical set -- and therefore admits a unique completion (that is, to the \"back circulant\" Latin square of order 6). Therefore, if c=n there exists a color profile P for which N(P)=1, not just N(P)\u22611 (mod 2).\n\nEDIT: I presented this problem to our research group at Monash and we improved the upper bound to c=1 (which was a bit surprising!). The idea came from the following critical set (call it C) of the back-circulant Latin square, which is related to the one above, but contains more entries than the one above (but this doesn't matter for this problem).\n\n\nWe observed that if every entry in the critical set above is assigned one colour, and the remaining entries another colour, then there is a unique Latin square with that colour profile. That is, we derive the colour profile from in the following way.\n\n123456     12345.   .....6\n234561     2345..   ....61\n345612 <-> 345... + ...612\n456123     45....   ..6123\n561234     5.....   .61234\n612345     ......   612345\n\nwhich gives rise to the following colour profile P:\n\n15   51   51\n24   42   42\n33   33   33\n42   24   24\n51   15   15\n06   06   06\n\nWe can deduce that any Latin square with the colour profile P will, in fact, contain the critical set C. Hence, N(P)=1.\n\nTo see how we deduce the critical set from the colour profile, we note that for the first colour, it contains 5 entries in the first row and column, 4 entries in the second row and column, and so on (and the same for columns). This selection of cells can take only one shape -- that is, it is unique. Then placing the symbols 1..5 in it can only be achieved in one way (to preserve the Latin property).\n\nSince this can be generalised for all n\u22652, the answer to your question \"what is the largest c such that for all colour profiles P, N(P)\u22610 (mod 2)\" is c=1.\n\nEDIT 2: We also discussed at our research meeting the complexity side of the problem.\n\nInstance: colour profile P\n\nQuestion: is N(P)\u22651?\n\nIn fact, there is an easy way to see that this problem is NP-complete, since (a) we can embed instances of the problem of partial Latin square completion in the above problem and (b) a Latin square together with its colouring can be used as a certificate.\n\nThe problem of partial Latin square completion was shown to be NP-complete in: C. J., Colbourn, The complexity of completing partial Latin squares, Discrete Appl. Math. 8 (1984), no. 1, 25--30.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nAh, this seems to answer the most well-defined aspect of my question, though I'll have to take some more time later to fully digest this.

Radius\nName: Name\nStatus: N/A\nAge: N/A\nLocation: N/A\nCountry: N/A\nDate: Around 1993\n\nQuestion: Is there any mathematical formula for determining the un-rolled length of a spiral? For instance, if I had a roll of ribbon that had a radius of two inches, and the ribbon was one sixteenth of an inch thick, how long would the ribbon be? If there is not a formula for it, what would be the best way to determine this?\n\nA very close approximation for this kind of spiral is to pretend that the roll of ribbon is a series of concentric circular loops of ribbon. Then, the length of each loop is 2 * pi * r, where r = the loop's radius and pi = 3.1415926...so the answer for your example would be: 2 * pi * (1/16 + 2/16 + 3/16 + ... + 32/16) = 2 * pi * 528/16. If the ribbon was on a spindle of radius, say, 1 inch, the sum would be (16/16 + 17/16 + ... + 32/16). An interesting related problem is find (and prove) a formula for ( 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N ) John Hawley\n\nHere is another approach. If we assume that the ribbon is tightly wound up (i.e., no gaps between the layers of ribbon), then the volume occupied by the 'disk' of wound-up ribbon equals the volume of the unwound strip (a very flat and long 'box'). Let R denote the radius of the 'disk', T the thickness of the ribbon, L its unwound length (the quantity we want to compute), and W its width. The wound-up volume is pi*R^2*W (\"R^2 means \"R squared\"), and the unwound volume is L*W*T. Setting these equal and solving for L, we get L = pi*R^2/T. For the values given (R=2 in., T=1/16 in.), we get L = 64*pi (about 201) inches. By the way, your idea of using a spiral would work. One could write an equation (polar coordinates would be the easiest choice) for a curve that would lie within the ribbon-say, at mid- interior. There is a formula for length of a curve, using integral calculus. As it happens, the answer you get is the same as that obtained above. If you would like more details on this calculus approach, please ask (here or via e- mail).\n\nRon Winther\n\nClick here to return to the Mathematics Archives\n\n\n\nEducational Programs\nBuilding 360\n9700 S.

Because many of the lines and variables have been optimized away, it is necessary to follow the C source and the corresponding disassembly simultaneously. I want the current line in the disassembler window to be highlighted each time I \"step instruction.\" Right now the cursor moves automatically, in the disassembler window, but hl-line-mode does not highlight the line that the cursor moved to.

But each time I step, the highlighting from hl-line-mode disappears in the inactive window.\n\nHow can I get a good visual indication of the \"current line\" in the disassembler window?

I tried this and found out that the gud-overlay-arrow-position is different from the gdb-disassembly-position overlay. Interestingly the gud-display-line function already has special handling for hl-line-mode, so regular source buffers already work as expected with hl-line-mode, even when the source buffer is not the active window.

Since the TSP route is not allowed to repeat vertices, once the greedy algorithm chooses $a,b,c,d$, it is forced to take the longest edge $d,a$ to return to the starting city.\n\n\nAs it already turned out in the other replies, your suggestion does not effectively solve the Travelling Salesman Problem, let me please indicate the best way known in the field of heuristic search (since I see Dijkstra's algorithm somewhat related to this field of Artificial Intelligence).\n\nA heuristic algorithm can return optimal solutions (though the sizes it can manage are relatively small as a matter of fact) and the following method was suggested by Richard Korf in the 90s. While it works perfectly for the symmetric travelling salesman problem (where the cost of the edge $(u,v)$ equals the cost of the same edge when traversed in the opposite direction $(v,u)$), it can be easily adapted to the alternative case of the asymmetric version.\n\nThe best approach (I am aware of) consists of running a Depth-First Branch-and-Bound heuristic search algorithm where the heuristic is the cost of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Since the MST can be computed in polynomial time with either the Prim's algorithm or the Kruskal's algorithm, then it can be expected to return solutions in a reasonable amount of time. For a wonderful discussion of these two algorithms I do strongly suggest you to have a look at The Algorithm Design Manual\n\nAs a matter of fact, let me highlight that since this approach was suggested not much progress have been seen in the field for deriving optimal bounds of this problem so that I do consider it to be a hot question in the field of combinatorial search.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\nI have no idea how anyone here didn't notice that the application of Dijkstra's algorithm would be entirely unnecessary in this case? You could implement this greedy algorithm by simply selecting the closest node, which is known apriori. Dijkstra's algorithm is used for discovering paths, but you are only taking a single step each time. This obviously does not find the optimal solution to the TSP, but many very good approaches do not find it either. All optimal solution finders for TSP are very computationally demanding.\n\n\nThe answer is no, that's not a good way of solving the TSP problem. A good counter example is where all the points are on a line, like the following:\n\n\nusing Dijsktra's algorithm, would make the poor salesman starting at point 0, first go to 1 then to 2 then to 3 ect. which is not the optimal.\n\nHope that helps. Have a look at the first chapter in Steven S. Skiena excellent book called \"The Algorithm Design\" it explains this example in more detail.\n\nThe TSP problem is not finding the shortest way between two points, but in making a route between all the points which are optimal. When you have the optimal route you can use Dijsktra to find the shortest path between each points in the route.\n\n  \u2022 2\n    $\\begingroup$ Dijkstra is a single source shortest path algorithm, but it wouldn't \"make\" the salesman start at 0, nor would it return a route. It just returns the shortest path tree, containing the shortest path to each vertex from the given source vertex. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Joe May 9 '12 at 18:25\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Traditionally, the TSP problem [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u2026 ] is \"Given a list of cities and their pairwise distances, the task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.\" Technically it's not possible to satisfy those requirements on a path-- you must either not return to the starting city, or repeat cities. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Joe May 9 '12 at 18:27\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ However, on a path, if we relax either of those constraints, then the problem is trivial. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Joe May 9 '12 at 18:28\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Of course, Dijkstra wouldn't make the salesman start at 0.

R is just a constant.\n\n    Solving for P you get:\n\n    P = nRT / V\n\n    Now, right after you close the lid on each container, notice that the number of molecules in each container is directly proportional to the volume of the container. Therefore the pressure will be the same. When you increase the temperature, it is proportional to the pressure in both cases, so when you increase the temperature equally much in both containers, you increase the pressure equally much. So the end pressure is the same.\n  4. Jan 29, 2014 #3\n    Thanks... this is how I see it as well... but I'm in disagreement with a PhD about it...

One is that you are rounding to the nearest mark. That introduces an uncertainty of exactly \u00b10.0625. Next is any error in the placing of the marks on the ruler. You could handle that by rounding the first uncertainty up a little, \u00b10.064, say. Third is any error in your decision of which is the nearest mark. That's the same in nature as the second error, but statistically independent.\n    Now, suppose you decide the error is \u00b10.07 and you measured the value as 30.375. It would be quite appropriate to write the answer as, say, 30.375\u00b10.070, strange though that may seem. But it would also be reasonable to compromise there, e.g. with 30.37\u00b10.08.\n\nHave something to add?\nDraft saved Draft deleted\n\nSimilar Discussions: Significant Digits Ruler -To what decimal point\n  1.

Jan 18, 2008 #4\n    yea i just did it with u as well but that weird, cause this question was in my first section for integral calc (where we basically onyl went through basic rules like power rule, and integrals of other trig functions)\n\n    but anyways\n\n    let u = cosx\n\n    du/dx = -sinx\n\n    now i integrate - 1/(u)^2 * du\n    = integral of -u^-2 *du\n\n    = u^-1\n\n    = cos^-1 x\n\n    = 1/cos x\n\n    = sec x\n\n  6.

Except for a small error, you forgot the Constant of Integration \"+ C\" at the end of the final result. :)\n  7.

You can also write\n    (sin x)/[(cos x)^2] as (1/cos x)\u00b7(sin x / cos x) = sec x tan x , which is the derivative of sec x . (This at least serves as a check on your result...)\n  8.

We let $x_1=13,y_1=8,x_2=9,y_2=6,x_3=4,y_3=2,x_4=8,y_4=4$ and the area is given by $$A=\\frac 12|13\\cdot 6+9\\cdot 2+4\\cdot 4+8\\cdot 8-9\\cdot 8-4\\cdot 6-8\\cdot 2-13\\cdot 4|\\\\=\\frac 12\\cdot 12=6$$\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ You answered with another person's answer? xD $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Billy Rubina Oct 13 '16 at 8:15\n  \u2022 4\n    $\\begingroup$ This is hitting a nail with a sledge hammer.
